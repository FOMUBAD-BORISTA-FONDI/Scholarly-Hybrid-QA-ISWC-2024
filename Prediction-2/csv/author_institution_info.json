            "Robert Sugden, FBA (born 26 August 1949) is an English author in the area of cognitive and behavioural economics. Professor Sugden's research combines game theory (mainly experimental game theory and coordination games) with moral and political philosophy. He is associated with the classical-liberal tradition of Hume, Mill, and Hayek. In his most cited work, Sugden explored how conventions of property, mutual aid, and voluntary supply of public goods can evolve spontaneously out of the interactions of self-interested individuals and can become moral norms. Sugden investigated a number of violations of the von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility axioms, and developed regret theory as an alternative with Graham Loomes. In support of this work, he developed a number of experimental methods to test theories of decision under risk. His work also deals with economic methods, in which he argues that economic models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world, but rather descriptions of imaginary worlds whose validity can only be inferred by how reasonable their predictions are. In The Community of Advantage, Sugden develops a contractarian approach to welfare economics that is based on opportunity sets and not individual preferences.  The shift from preferences to opportunity is partly motivated by recent experimental work indicating that individuals lack well-defined preferences.  In 2019, The Community of Advantage was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler Award for outstanding contribution in the field of the philosophy of the social sciences."

            "Ronald E. Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric. Ronald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993. Professor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the information age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\" Day's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation. Day has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006. Day's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence. In 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data through MIT Press where he \"examines information 'as a cultural and social phenomenonu201d during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.'\" Again, he relies on his knowledge of Briet to explore indexing and \"the transition of indexes from explicit professional structures that mediate the relation of user needs and documentary information seeking, searching, and retrieving to being implicit infrastructural devices in everyday information and communication acts.\" It was winner of the Best Information Science Book Award from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2015. In this respect, this book is not unlike an earlier work by Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star entitled Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences where the traditional Aristotelian manner of classification breaks down in social contexts. In addition to these four books, Day has published nearly forty articles relating to the field of Library and Information Science."

            "Mary Shaw (born 1943) is an American software engineer, and the Alan J. Perlis Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, known for her work in the field of software architecture. Mary M. Shaw was born in Washington D.C. in 1943. Her father (Eldon Shaw) was a civil engineer and economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and her mother (Mary Shaw) was a homemaker. Shaw attended high school in Bethesda, Maryland, during the Sputnik cold war era during which technology was rapidly improving[citation needed]. In high school, Shaw participated for two summers during high school in an after school program which taught students about computers. This program run by International Business Machines (IBM) and was a chance for student to explore fields outside of the normal curriculum. This was Shaw's first introduction to computers. Shaw obtained her BA from Rice University around 1965, and her PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1972. With Marion Cru00e9hange (1937 u2013 2022), a French computer scientist who got a PhD in Computer Science in 1961, she is considered a pioneer in computer science. After her graduation at Rice University, Shaw had started her career in industry, working as systems programmer at the Research Analysis Corporation. She also continued to do research at Rice University. In 1972 she joined the Carnegie Mellon University faculty, where she was eventually appointed Professor of Computer Science. From 1984 to 1987 she was also Chief Scientist at its Software Engineering Institute, from 1992 to 1999 Associate Dean for Professional Education, and from 2001 to 2006 Co-Director of the Sloan Software Industry Center. In 2011, Mary Shaw and David Garlan received the Outstanding Research Award from ACM SIGSOFT, the Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Software Engineering, for their \"significant and lasting software engineering research contributions through the development and promotion of software architecture.\" On October 3, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Shaw with National Medal of Technology and Innovation. She was named recipient of the award in 2012. Shaw's main area of research interest is software engineering, including architectural, educational and historical aspects. Shaw authored seminal works in the field of software architecture along with David Garlan. Shaw's most cited work \"Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline,\" co-authored with David Garlan, examines the concept of \"architectures for software systems as well as better ways to support software development.\" The book aims: \"... to bring together the useful abstractions of systems design and the notations and tools of the software developer, and look at patterns used for system organization... to illustrate the discipling and examine the ways in which architectural design can impact software design. Our selection emphasizes informal descriptions, touching lightly on formal notations and specifications and on tools to support them.\"In this work Garlan and Shaw \"describe an architecture of a system as a collection of computational components together with a description of the interactions between these componentsu2014the connectors.\" A component is simply described as \"the elements that perform computation.\" In 2011 Shaw and Garlan were awarded the Outstanding Research Award for 2011 by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in honor of their pioneering research in the field of Software Architecture. William Scherlis, the director of CMU's Institute for Software Research, commented on Shaw and Garlan contribution: The term 'software architecture' was first used in the late 1960s, but its significance didn't become clear until almost 20 years later, when David and Mary asserted that architecture could be addressed using systematic approaches. Their work and that of their colleagues here at Carnegie Mellon has since led to engineering methods for architectural modeling, analysis and identification of architecture-level patterns, the use of which has now become standard in the engineering of larger scale software systems.Articles, a selection:"

            "Samer Hassan is a computer scientist, social scientist, activist and researcher, focused on the use of decentralized technologies to support commons-based collaboration. He is Associate Professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) and Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He is the recipient of an ERC Grant of 1.5Mu20ac with the P2P Models project, to research blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations for the collaborative economy. Samer Hassan is a scholar with an interdisciplinary background, which combines computer sciences with social sciences and activism. He received a degree in Computer Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in Spain. He also studied 3 years of Political Science at the distance learning university UNED. He has then undertaken a PhD in Social Simulation at the department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of UCM, supervised by the computer scientist Juan Pavu00f3n and the sociologist Millu00e1n Arroyo-Menu00e9ndez. He has been researching in several institutions, funded by several scholarships and awards, most notably Harvard's Real Colegio Complutense, and the Spanish postdoctoral grants Juan de la Cierva and Josu00e9 Castillejo. Thus, he was a visiting researcher at the Centre for Research in Social Simulation, in the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey in the UK, working under the supervision of Nigel Gilbert (2007-2008), and a lecturer at the American University of Science and Technology in Lebanon (2010u201311). He was selected as Fellow at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (2015-2017) and is presently a Faculty Associate at the same structure. As an activist, Samer Hassan has been engaged in both offline (La Tabacalera de Lavapiu00e9s, Medialab-Prado) and online (Ourproject.org, Barrapunto, Wikipedia) initiatives. He was accredited as a grassroots facilitator by the Altekio Cooperative. He co-founded the Comunes Nonprofit in 2009 and the Move Commons webtool project in 2010. He has co-organized practitioner-oriented workshops on platform co-ops and free/open source decentralized tools for communities, and has presented his work in non-academic conferences of Mozilla, the Internet Archive, and others. As a privacy advocate, he co-created a course on cyber-ethics which has been teaching since 2013 (as of 2021). He was co-founder of the Sci-Fdi Spanish science-fiction magazine. Samer Hassan's PhD thesis focused on the methodological challenges for building data-driven social simulation models. The main model built simulated the transition from modern values to postmodern values in Spain. His methodological work also explored the combination of different Artificial Intelligence technologies, i.e. software agents with fuzzy logic, data mining, natural language processing, and microsimulation. Hassan's interdisciplinary research spans multiple fields, including online collaborative communities, decentralized technologies, blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations, free/libre/open source software, Commons-based peer production, agent-based social simulation, social movements and cyberethics. He has published more than 50 works in these fields, and is recently focused on experimenting with multiple software systems to facilitate commons-based peer production, e.g. semantic-web labelling for commons-based initiatives, distribution of value in peer production communities, agent-supported online assemblies, decentralized real-time collaborative software, decentralized blockchain based reputation, or blockchain-enabled commons governance. Hassan was Principal Investigator of the UCM partner in the EU-funded P2Pvalue project on building decentralized web-tools for collaborative communities. As such, he led the team that created SwellRT, a federated backend-as-a-service focused to ease development of apps featuring real-time collaboration. Intellectual Property of this project was transferred to the Apache Software Foundation in 2017. As part of this research line, Hassan's team also develop two SwellRT-based apps, \"Teem\" for management of social collectives and Jetpad, a federated real time editor. He presented the innovations concerning these software at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center and Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society. Other research lines offered outcomes beyond publications. \"Wikichron\", coled by Javier Arroyo, is a web tool to visualize MediaWiki community metrics, currently in production and available for third-parties. \"Decentralized Science\", led by Hassan's PhD student u00c1mbar Tenorio-Fornu00e9s, is a framework to facilitate decentralized infrastructure and open peer review in the scientific publication process, which has been selected by the European Commission to receive funding as a spin-off social enterprise. His research on blockchain and crowdfunding models awarded him with a commission from Triple Canopy. His team pushed forward a mapping of the ecosystem of blockchain for social good, led by the Joint Research Centre and published by the European Commission. As part of his ERC project P2P Models, Samer Hassan and his team are investigating whether blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations could contribute to improving the governance of commons-oriented communities, both online and offline. Their work has been showcased for tackling the impact of blockchain on governance, proposing alternatives to the current sharing economy, emerging forms of techno-social systems like NFTs, or giving relevance to gender issues in the field. Hassan was invited to present the project achievements in Harvard Kennedy School, MIT Media Lab, Harvard's Data Privacy Lab, Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Harvard's SEAS EconCS. British MP and Opposition Leader Ed Miliband showcased his research and its potential impact on policy."

            "Odest Chadwicke Jenkins (born 1975) is an American computer scientist who is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

            "Rosalyn J. Moran is a British neuroscientist and computational psychiatrist. She is deputy director of the King's College London Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Her research looks to understand neural algorithms through brain connectivity. Moran grew up in Ireland, where she studied applied mathematics at the local boys school. Moran was an undergraduate and postgraduate student in electronic engineering at the University College Dublin. Her doctoral research applied information theory to biomedical signal processing. During her PhD, she met a scientist who was combining electrical and chemical analysis of schizophrenia, and became interested in pursuing a career in neuroscience. She was a postdoctoral researcher at University College London supported by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.[citation needed] Moran moved to Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute in 2012, where she spent four years as an assistant professor. She returned to the United Kingdom in 2016 and joined the University of Bristol as a senior lecturer. In 2018, she was made associate professor at King's College London. She became deputy director of the King's Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2022.[citation needed] Moran's research combines artificial intelligence, Bayesian inference and experimental neurobiology to understand brain connectivity and neural processing. She is interested in how neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenaline, serotonin) in decision making. She uses deep networks to model diseases, with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia. Moran has investigated the free energy principle, an all-purpose mode of the brain and human behaviour. The free energy principle is based on surprise minimisation, brains work to minimise free energy. Moran has argued that the free energy principle offers an alternative rationale for generative artificial intelligence."

            "Arvind is the Johnson Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He was also elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 for contributions to dataflow and multithread computing and the development of tools for the high-level synthesis of digital electronics hardware. Arvind's research interests include formal verification of large-scale digital systems using guarded atomic actions, memory models, and cache coherence protocols for parallel computing architectures and programming languages. Past work was instrumental in the development of dynamic dataflow architectures, two parallel languages, Id and pH, and the compiling of such languages on parallel machines. At IIT Kanpur, he earned a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in technology (with an emphasis in electrical engineering) in 1969. In that process, he discovered that he was keenly interested in computers. Then, at the University of Minnesota, he earned a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in computer science in 1972, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in computer science in 1973. Arvind conducted his thesis research in operating systems on mathematical models of program behavior. At the University of California, Irvine, where he taught from 1974 to 1978, he became interested in computer architecture and programming languages. Arvind taught at IIT's Kanpur campus in 1977 and 1978. In 1978, he joined the MIT faculty. He served as the Chief Technical Advisor to the United-Nations-sponsored Knowledge Based Computer Systems project in India from 1986 to 1992. During 1992u201393, he was the Fujitsu Visiting Professor at the University of Tokyo.[citation needed] In 1992, Arvind and his CSAIL team collaborated with Motorola in completing the Monsoon dataflow machine and associated software. A dozen Monsoons were installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and other universities before Monsoon was retired to the Computer History Museum in California. In 2000, Arvind took two years off from teaching at MIT to build Sandburst, Inc, a fabless manufacturing semiconductor company. He served as its president until his return to MIT in 2002.[citation needed] In 2006, Sandburst was acquired by Broadcom Corporation. In 2003, he cofounded Bluespec, Inc., headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. They produce proven electronic design automation (EDA) synthesis toolsets. With Lennart Augustsson, Arvind codeveloped the programming language Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV), a high-level functional programming hardware description language, which is a Haskell variant extended to handle chip design and electronic design automation in general. He served as the General Chair for the International Conference on Supercomputing held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in June 2005.[citation needed] He has also served as the Engineering and Computer Science Jury Chair for the Infosys Prize from 2019 onwards. Arvind was the first to occupy the N. Rama Rao Chair in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT. He served as chair from 1998 to 1999. Also during this time he taught a few weeks each semester at the CSE department of IIT, Kanpur. Arvind's current research uses term-rewriting systems (TRSs) for high-level specification and description of architectures and protocols. The Computation Structures Group at MIT, which he heads, uses TRSs to design faster hardware and allow for more exploration of designs.[citation needed] Along with R. S. Nikhil, Arvind published the book Implicit parallel programming in pH in 2001. \"pH\" is a programming language based on Haskell with special support for parallel processing. Among the most significant and/or recent articles he authored or co-authored that have been published: Arvind has also served on the editorial board of several journals including the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, and the Journal of Functional Programming. Arvind has received the following awards: the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award (1994), Distinguished Alumnus Award, I.I.T. Kanpur (1999), Distinguished Alumnus Award, University of Minnesota (2001), and the Outstanding Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota (2008). He was selected as an IEEE Fellow in 1994 and an ACM Fellow in 2006. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 and is currently a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT."

            "Thomas G. Dietterich is emeritus professor of computer science at Oregon State University. He is one of the pioneers of the field of machine learning. He served as executive editor of Machine Learning (journal) (1992u201398) and helped co-found the Journal of Machine Learning Research. In response to the media's attention on the dangers of artificial intelligence, Dietterich has been quoted for an academic perspective to a broad range of media outlets including National Public Radio, Business Insider, Microsoft Research, CNET, and The Wall Street Journal. Among his research contributions were the invention of error-correcting output coding to multi-class classification, the formalization of the multiple-instance problem, the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning, and the development of methods for integrating non-parametric regression trees into probabilistic graphical models. Thomas Dietterich was born in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1954. His family later moved to New Jersey and then again to Illinois, where Tom graduated from Naperville Central High School. Dietterich then entered Oberlin College and began his undergraduate studies. In 1977, Dietterich graduated from Oberlin with a degree in mathematics, focusing on probability and statistics. Dietterich spent the following two years at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After those two years, he began his doctoral studies in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Dietterich received his Ph.D. in 1984 and moved to Corvallis, Oregon, where he was hired as an assistant professor in computer science. in 2013, he was named \"Distinguished Professor\". In 2016, Dietterich retired from his position at Oregon State University. Throughout his career, Dietterich has worked to promote scientific publication and conference presentations. For many years, he was the editor of the MIT Press series on Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning. He also held the position of co-editor of the Morgan Claypool Synthesis Series on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He has organized several conferences and workshops including serving as Technical Program Co-Chair of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-90), Technical Program Chair of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS-2000) and General Chair of NIPS-2001. He served as founding President of the International Machine Learning Society and he has been a member of the IMLS Board since its founding. He is currently also a member of the Steering Committee of the Asian Conference on Machine Learning. Professor Dietterich is interested in all aspects of machine learning. There are three major strands of his research. First, he is interested in the fundamental questions of artificial intelligence and how machine learning can provide the basis for building integrated intelligent systems. Second, he is interested in ways that people and computers can collaborate to solve challenging problems. And third, he is interested in applying machine learning to problems in the ecological sciences and ecosystem management as part of the emerging field of computational sustainability. Over his career, he has worked on a wide variety of problems ranging from drug design to user interfaces to computer security. His current focus is on ways that computer science methods can help advance ecological science and improve our management of the Earth's ecosystems. This passion has led to several projects including research in wildfire management, invasive vegetation and understanding the distribution and migration of birds. For example, Dietterich's research is helping scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology answer questions like: How do birds decide to migrate north? How do they know when to land and stopover for a few days? How do they choose where to make a nest? Tens of thousands of volunteer birdwatchers (citizen scientists) all over the world contribute data to the study by submitting their bird sightings to the eBird website. The amount of data is overwhelming u2013 in March 2012 they had over 3.1 million bird observations. Machine learning can uncover patterns in data to model the migration of species. But there are many other applications for the same techniques which will allow organizations to better manage our forests, oceans, and endangered species, as well as improve traffic flow, water systems, the electrical power grid, and more. I realized I wanted to have an impact on something that really mattered u2013 and certainly the whole Earth's ecosystem, of which we are a part, is under threat in so many ways. And so if there's some way that I can use my technical skills to improve both the science base and the tools needed for policy and management decisions, then I would like to do that. I am passionate about that.Dietterich has argued that the most realistic risks about the dangers of artificial intelligence are basic mistakes, breakdowns and cyberattacks, and the fact that it simply may not always work, rather than machines that become super powerful or destroy the human race. Dietterich considers machines becoming self-aware and trying to exterminate humans to be more science fiction than scientific fact. But to the extent that computer systems are given increasingly dangerous tasks, and asked to learn from and interpret their experiences, he said they may simply make mistakes. Instead, much of the work done in the AI safety community does indeed focus around accidents and design flaws. Thomas Dietterich was honored by Oregon State University in the spring of 2013 as a \"Distinguished Professor\" for his work as a pioneer in the field of machine learning and being one of the mostly highly cited scientists in his field. He has also earned exclusive \"Fellow\" status in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association for Computing Machinery. Over his career, he obtained more than $30 million in research grants, helped build a world-class research group at Oregon State, and created three software companies. He also co-founded two of the field's leading journals and was elected first president of the International Machine Learning Society. His other awards and honors include:"

            "Alex Mogilner is an American professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Biology at New York University. His major contribution to science are in the areas of cell motility and division and innovations in cell imaging. Mogilner was born in the Soviet Union on May 22, 1962.  He received his doctorate in physics in 1990 at the Ural Division of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in his hometown of Ekaterinburg. After two years of research at the University of Manitoba, he returned to graduate school at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and received his Ph.D in applied mathematics, a program that combined math and biology. His current work is in computational biology, which combines chemistry, biology, math and physics.[citation needed] One of Mogilner's research topics is the mitotic spindle and how it is assembled. The mitotic spindle is what pulls conjoined chromosomes apart during cell division. Mogilner hypothesized that the chromosomes were surrounded by proteins that directed the microtubules toward them. A few years after, research in Germany confirmed his prediction. His key papers on the subject have been cited hundreds of times; the most cited one, in Biophysical Journal has been cited 614 times by October 2014. He is an Associate Editor at the Journal of Cell Biology and Bulletin of Mathematical Biology."

            "Eddie Kohler is a computer scientist specializing in networks and operating systems. He is currently a professor of computer science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Prior to Harvard, he was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Kohler co-founded Mazu Networks in 2000 and served as its Chief Scientist until it was acquired in 2009. In 2006, he was named as one of the Top 35 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review magazine.  In 2014, he received the SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award, an award given annually to a researcher who has made \"contributions that are highly creative, innovative, and possibly high-risk, in keeping with the visionary spirit of Mark Weiser.\" He is also the author of the HotCRP conference management software. In 2005, Kohler (with David Maziu00e8res) wrote a paper titled \"Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List\" and sarcastically submitted it to a conference from which the two did not wish to receive further communications. Years later, the paper (submitted by another scientist to an ostensibly peer-reviewed technical journal) was accepted for publication, despite a nonsensical body text."

            "Manish Parashar is a Presidential Professor in the School of Computing, Director of the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute and Chair in Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Utah. He also currently serves as Office Director in the US National Science Foundationu2019s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. Parashar is the editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, and Founding Chair of the IEEE Technical Community on High Performance Computing.xa0 He is an AAAS Fellow, ACM Fellow, and IEEE Fellow. As a leader in cyberinfrastructure research and policy, he has advocated for a national strategic computing reserve and the democratization of cyberinfrastructureu2019s use and impact. He also focuses on the importance of translational computer science, which bridges foundational, use-inspired, and applied research with the delivery and deployment of its outcomes to a target community. Parashar received a BE degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Bombay University, India, and MS and PhD degrees in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University. Prior to joining the University of Utah, he was a faculty member at Rutgers University. Parasharu2019s work enables advanced application formulations, such as those based on dynamically adaptive, coupled methods, and data-driven workflows, to be implemented on extreme-scale high-performance computing systems. His contributions have included innovations in data structures and algorithms, programming abstractions, and runtime systems. He has pioneered the use of autonomic computing techniques to address application/system complexity and uncertainty. He has also deployed open-source software encapsulating these research innovations, which directly impact a range of applications. A leader in structured adaptive mesh refinement, Parashar is one of the earliest researchers to address scalable SAMR. His research has included a theoretical framework for locality preserving distributed and dynamic data-structures for SAMR, programming abstractions that enable distributed, dynamically adaptive formulations to be directly expressed, and a family of innovative partitioning algorithms that incorporate system/applications characteristics, and mechanisms for actively managing SAMR grid-hierarchies. These contributions continue to enable truly scalable SAMR applications and have led to realistic simulations of complex phenomena, such as colliding black-holes and neutron stars, forest fire propagation, and fluid flows in the human heart. As Assistant Director for Strategic Computing in the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, Parashar led the development of a national strategy for the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem and the formulation of the National Strategic Computing Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since becoming Office Director at the National Science Foundationu2019s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, Parashar has led the development of NSFu2019s strategic vision for a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem for 21st century science and engineering. A key element of this vision is ensuring equitable access and democratizing cyberinfrastructureu2019s use and impact. He also co-chairs the National Science and Technology Councilu2019s Subcommittee on the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem."

            "Odest Chadwicke Jenkins (born 1975) is an American computer scientist who is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

            "Manish Parashar is a Presidential Professor in the School of Computing, Director of the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute and Chair in Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Utah. He also currently serves as Office Director in the US National Science Foundationu2019s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. Parashar is the editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, and Founding Chair of the IEEE Technical Community on High Performance Computing.xa0 He is an AAAS Fellow, ACM Fellow, and IEEE Fellow. As a leader in cyberinfrastructure research and policy, he has advocated for a national strategic computing reserve and the democratization of cyberinfrastructureu2019s use and impact. He also focuses on the importance of translational computer science, which bridges foundational, use-inspired, and applied research with the delivery and deployment of its outcomes to a target community. Parashar received a BE degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Bombay University, India, and MS and PhD degrees in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University. Prior to joining the University of Utah, he was a faculty member at Rutgers University. Parasharu2019s work enables advanced application formulations, such as those based on dynamically adaptive, coupled methods, and data-driven workflows, to be implemented on extreme-scale high-performance computing systems. His contributions have included innovations in data structures and algorithms, programming abstractions, and runtime systems. He has pioneered the use of autonomic computing techniques to address application/system complexity and uncertainty. He has also deployed open-source software encapsulating these research innovations, which directly impact a range of applications. A leader in structured adaptive mesh refinement, Parashar is one of the earliest researchers to address scalable SAMR. His research has included a theoretical framework for locality preserving distributed and dynamic data-structures for SAMR, programming abstractions that enable distributed, dynamically adaptive formulations to be directly expressed, and a family of innovative partitioning algorithms that incorporate system/applications characteristics, and mechanisms for actively managing SAMR grid-hierarchies. These contributions continue to enable truly scalable SAMR applications and have led to realistic simulations of complex phenomena, such as colliding black-holes and neutron stars, forest fire propagation, and fluid flows in the human heart. As Assistant Director for Strategic Computing in the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, Parashar led the development of a national strategy for the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem and the formulation of the National Strategic Computing Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since becoming Office Director at the National Science Foundationu2019s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, Parashar has led the development of NSFu2019s strategic vision for a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem for 21st century science and engineering. A key element of this vision is ensuring equitable access and democratizing cyberinfrastructureu2019s use and impact. He also co-chairs the National Science and Technology Councilu2019s Subcommittee on the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem."

            "Robin Roberson Murphy is an American computer scientist and roboticist. She is the Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. She is known as a founder of the fields of rescue robotics and human-robot interaction and for inserting robots into disasters. Her case studies of how unmanned systems under perform in the field led cognitive systems engineering researcher David Woods to pose the (Robin) Murphy's Law of Autonomy: a deployment of robotic systems will fall short of the target level of autonomy, creating or exacerbating a shortfall in mechanisms for coordination with human problem holders. Her TED talk u201cThese Robots Come to the Rescue After a Disasteru201d was listed in TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking as one of the examples of a good TED talk. Murphy is also known for using science fiction as an innovative method of teaching artificial intelligence and robotics. Murphy was raised in Douglas, Georgia. She received her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1980, worked in the process safety industry, and returned to Georgia Tech for a master's (1988) and PhD. (1992) in computer science under the direction of Ronald Arkin. She was the first person to graduate from the Georgia Tech College of Computing with a PhD in robotics. She was an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines from 1992 to 1998, then moved to the University of South Florida as an associate professor in 1998 and was promoted to full professor in 2003. In 2008, Murphy moved to Texas A&M University. She was a member of the Defense Science Study Group from 1997 to 1998; this led to her involvement on numerous science boards, including the Defense Science Board and the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. Murphy began research into disaster robotics in 1995, motivated by the Oklahoma City bombing.  Murphy was the director of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASASR)  from 2002 to 2018, and now serves as the vice-president. Through CRASAR she participated in the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster (2001), considered the first use of robots for the emergency response phase of a disaster. Since then she has helped insert unmanned ground, aerial, and marine systems into 27 disasters including Hurricane Katrina, which is considered the first use of small unmanned aerial systems, the Fukishima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011), the Tu014dhoku tsunami (2011),  the Syrian Boat Refugee crisis (2016), and Hurricane Harvey (2017). She wrote the seminal text Disaster Robotics, MIT Press, in 2014."

            "Nicolas Gisin (born 1952) is a Swiss physicist and professor at the University of Geneva, working on the foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and communication. His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies. Nicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government. On 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian. Gisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title u201cClub of the Yearu201d by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history."

Crawfordu2019s research focuses on social change and media technologies, particularly on the intersection of humans, mobile devices, and social networks. Her research examines how AI affects various aspects of human life, such as gender, race, and economic status. She argues that AI systems are not neutral or objective, but rather reflect and reinforce existing systems of power and inequality. She also explores the environmental and ethical impacts of AI, as well as the historical and cultural contexts of its development. She has published on cultures of technology use and the way media histories inform the present, and has exhibited creative works in music and art at museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Crawford was previously part of the Canberra electronic music duo B(if)tek (along with Nicole Skeltys) and released three albums between 1998 and 2003. Crawford co-founded the Sydney-based Deluxe Mood Recordings record label and is a member of the Clan Analogue music collective. As a writer Crawford has written for The Sydney Morning Herald and Foreign Policy. She was a Fellow of the Centre for Policy Development and in March 2008 she was selected as one of 1000 Australians to attend the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra on 19u201320 April 2008. She is a member of the feminist collective Deep Lab. In 2017 Crawford established the research institute AI Now Institute with Meredith Whittaker. It is associated with New York University Tandon School of Engineering. In 2019 she was the inaugural holder of the AI & Justice visiting chair at u00c9cole Normale Supu00e9rieure in Paris, in partnership with the  Fondation Abeona. Crawford has a PhD from the University of Sydney. In 2006 her book based on this dissertation, Adult Themes u2013 Rewriting the Rules of Adulthood, won the individual category of the Manning Clark National Cultural Award and in 2008 she received the biennial medal for outstanding scholarship from the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Crawford has spoken and published academic papers on such topics as social media, government regulation of media content, the interplay between gender and mobile devices, young people and sexting, and big data. She has given keynote addresses at venues such as the 2013 O'Reilly Strata Conference and the 2013 DataEDGE conference hosted by the University of California, Berkeley School of Information. She co-authored a book titled Understanding the Internet: Language, Technology, Media, and Power in 2014. She published a book Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence through Yale University Press in 2021.

She has served as Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission, and she was formerly a member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation Board of Directors.  Previously she was a researcher at AT&T Labs-Research and taught in the Stern School of Business at New York University. She has authored over 110 research papers on online privacy, phishing and semantic attacks, spam, electronic voting, anonymous publishing, usable access control, and other topics. Cranor was a member of the first class to graduate from the Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. She received a bachelor's degree in Engineering and Public Policy, master's degrees in Technology and Human Affairs, and Computer Science, and a doctorate in Engineering and Policy, all from Washington University in St. Louis. At CMU, Cranor's research has largely focused on privacy policies and passwords. Cranor is not only a leading researcher but also a tough critic of the online ad industry's privacy initiatives. In 2008, she blasted Web companies for crafting unreadable privacy policies. She said in a report that online privacy policies take users an average of 10 minutes to read. That report also said that if every U.S. Web user read the privacy policy at every site visited, the time spent reading privacy policies would total an estimated 44.3 billion hours per year. Cranor led the development of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project at the World Wide Web Consortium and authored the book Web Privacy with P3P. She also led the development of the Privacy Bird P3P user agent and the Privacy Finder P3P search engine.[citation needed] Cranor has played a key role in building the usable privacy and security research community, having co-edited the book Security and Usability (O'Reilly 2005) and founded the Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS). Cranor is a co-founder of Wombat Security Technologies, Inc and has authored over 150 research papers on online privacy, usable security, and other topics. She is a member of the feminist collective Deep Lab. In 2003, she was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2013, Cranor's Security Blanket won Honorable Mention in the International Science & Engineering Visualization Challenge presented by Science and the National Science Foundation. She gave a TEDx talk in March 2014 entitled, \"What's Wrong with your pa$$w0rd.\" In 2014, she was elected to ACM Fellow For contributions to research and education in usable privacy and security. In 2016, was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 2017, she was elected to the CHI Academy. At the same conference, Cranor was awarded a prestigious Best Paper award for her paper titled Design and Evaluation of a Data-Driven Password Meter. Cranor is married to Chuck Cranor, a fellow researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. They have three children together."

He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

            "Stefan Savage (born 1969) is an American computer science researcher, currently a Professor in the Systems and Networking Group at the University of California, San Diego. There, he holds the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Chair in Information and Computer Science.  Savage is widely cited in computer security, particularly in the areas of email spam, network worms and malware propagation, distributed denial of service (DDOS) mitigation and traceback, automotive hacking and wireless security. He received his undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington (2002). In 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published \"Sting\", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement. In 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems. In 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks. Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer. In 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network. In 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were \"propagating\", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005. In 2005, Ishwar Ramani and Stefan Savage developed Syncscan algorithm that cuts the time needed to switch between Wi-Fi access points. In 2004, Savage was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship, in 2010 he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and in 2013, he received the ACM SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award. In 2015, he received the ACM Prize in Computing for \"innovative research in network security, privacy, and reliability that has taught us to view attacks and attackers as elements of an integrated technological, societal, and economic system.\" In 2017, he was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow (the \"genius grant\") for his body of work. Savage was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021  and was named a recipient of the American Association for the Advancement of Science-administered Golden Goose Award the same year. In 2022, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering."

Richtmyer Prize (1997) David Turnbull Prize (1998) Distinguished Teacheru2013Scholar Prize (2001) Memory Ride Prize for Alzheimer Research (2001) Dwight Nicholson Medal (2003) Teresiana Medal (2004) Boltzmann Medal (2004) Zenith Fellow Award of the Alzheimer Association (2005) Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize (2008) Senior Award, European Complex Systems Society (2014) Harry Eugene Stanley (born March 28, 1941) is an American physicist and University Professor at Boston University. He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics. Stanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962. He performed biological physics research with Max Delbru00fcck in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967. Stanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph  Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971. Stanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden. Stanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nu00e0 infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks. His seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed with Texeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume [H. E. Stanley and J. Teixeira, u201cInterpretation of The Unusual Behavior of H2O and D2O at Low Temperatures: Tests of a Percolation Modelu201d J. Chem. Phys. 73, 3404u20133422 (1980)]. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of wateru2019s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford. Stanley coined the term u2018econophysicsu2019 in 1994 to denote the field of physics dealing with economic phenomena. His group has found empirical laws governing economic fluctuations, and proposed statistical mechanics models to explain their origins.   The ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201. Stanley is committed to education at all levels, from high school to graduate studies.  He has served as thesis advisor to 114 Ph.D. students and has collaborated with 211 postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. He is also active in worldwide efforts for achieving gender balance in the physical sciences. Stanley has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2004), the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.  He is an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Physical Society. He is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), and at Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest, Hungary).  Stanley awarded the 2004 APS Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, \"For his extraordinary contributions to human rights, for his initiatives on behalf of female physicists, and for his caring and supportive relationship with those who have worked in his laboratory.\" For his contributions to phase transitions Stanley received the 2004 Boltzmann Medal, awarded by International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the American Physical Society 2008 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize. He was awarded the Teresiana Medal in Complex Systems Research given by the University of Pavia.  He also received the Distinguished Teaching Scholar  Director's Award from the National Science Foundation, the Nicholson Medal for Human Outreach from the American Physical Society, a Guggenheim Fellowship (1979), the David Turnbull Prize from the Materials Research Society (1998), a BP Venture Research Award, the Floyd K. Richtmyer Memorial Lectureship Award (1997), the Memory Ride Award for Alzheimer Research, and the Massachusetts Professor of the Year awarded by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Stanley has received nine Doctorates Honoris Causa, from Bar-Ilan University Ramat Gan, (Israel), Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest).

            "Ronald E. Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric. Ronald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993. Professor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the information age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\" Day's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation. Day has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006. Day's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence. In 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data through MIT Press where he \"examines information 'as a cultural and social phenomenonu201d during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.'\" Again, he relies on his knowledge of Briet to explore indexing and \"the transition of indexes from explicit professional structures that mediate the relation of user needs and documentary information seeking, searching, and retrieving to being implicit infrastructural devices in everyday information and communication acts.\" It was winner of the Best Information Science Book Award from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2015. In this respect, this book is not unlike an earlier work by Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star entitled Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences where the traditional Aristotelian manner of classification breaks down in social contexts. In addition to these four books, Day has published nearly forty articles relating to the field of Library and Information Science."

            "Samer Hassan is a computer scientist, social scientist, activist and researcher, focused on the use of decentralized technologies to support commons-based collaboration. He is Associate Professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) and Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He is the recipient of an ERC Grant of 1.5Mu20ac with the P2P Models project, to research blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations for the collaborative economy. Samer Hassan is a scholar with an interdisciplinary background, which combines computer sciences with social sciences and activism. He received a degree in Computer Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in Spain. He also studied 3 years of Political Science at the distance learning university UNED. He has then undertaken a PhD in Social Simulation at the department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of UCM, supervised by the computer scientist Juan Pavu00f3n and the sociologist Millu00e1n Arroyo-Menu00e9ndez. He has been researching in several institutions, funded by several scholarships and awards, most notably Harvard's Real Colegio Complutense, and the Spanish postdoctoral grants Juan de la Cierva and Josu00e9 Castillejo. Thus, he was a visiting researcher at the Centre for Research in Social Simulation, in the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey in the UK, working under the supervision of Nigel Gilbert (2007-2008), and a lecturer at the American University of Science and Technology in Lebanon (2010u201311). He was selected as Fellow at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (2015-2017) and is presently a Faculty Associate at the same structure. As an activist, Samer Hassan has been engaged in both offline (La Tabacalera de Lavapiu00e9s, Medialab-Prado) and online (Ourproject.org, Barrapunto, Wikipedia) initiatives. He was accredited as a grassroots facilitator by the Altekio Cooperative. He co-founded the Comunes Nonprofit in 2009 and the Move Commons webtool project in 2010. He has co-organized practitioner-oriented workshops on platform co-ops and free/open source decentralized tools for communities, and has presented his work in non-academic conferences of Mozilla, the Internet Archive, and others. As a privacy advocate, he co-created a course on cyber-ethics which has been teaching since 2013 (as of 2021). He was co-founder of the Sci-Fdi Spanish science-fiction magazine. Samer Hassan's PhD thesis focused on the methodological challenges for building data-driven social simulation models. The main model built simulated the transition from modern values to postmodern values in Spain. His methodological work also explored the combination of different Artificial Intelligence technologies, i.e. software agents with fuzzy logic, data mining, natural language processing, and microsimulation. Hassan's interdisciplinary research spans multiple fields, including online collaborative communities, decentralized technologies, blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations, free/libre/open source software, Commons-based peer production, agent-based social simulation, social movements and cyberethics. He has published more than 50 works in these fields, and is recently focused on experimenting with multiple software systems to facilitate commons-based peer production, e.g. semantic-web labelling for commons-based initiatives, distribution of value in peer production communities, agent-supported online assemblies, decentralized real-time collaborative software, decentralized blockchain based reputation, or blockchain-enabled commons governance. Hassan was Principal Investigator of the UCM partner in the EU-funded P2Pvalue project on building decentralized web-tools for collaborative communities. As such, he led the team that created SwellRT, a federated backend-as-a-service focused to ease development of apps featuring real-time collaboration. Intellectual Property of this project was transferred to the Apache Software Foundation in 2017. As part of this research line, Hassan's team also develop two SwellRT-based apps, \"Teem\" for management of social collectives and Jetpad, a federated real time editor. He presented the innovations concerning these software at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center and Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society. Other research lines offered outcomes beyond publications. \"Wikichron\", coled by Javier Arroyo, is a web tool to visualize MediaWiki community metrics, currently in production and available for third-parties. \"Decentralized Science\", led by Hassan's PhD student u00c1mbar Tenorio-Fornu00e9s, is a framework to facilitate decentralized infrastructure and open peer review in the scientific publication process, which has been selected by the European Commission to receive funding as a spin-off social enterprise. His research on blockchain and crowdfunding models awarded him with a commission from Triple Canopy. His team pushed forward a mapping of the ecosystem of blockchain for social good, led by the Joint Research Centre and published by the European Commission. As part of his ERC project P2P Models, Samer Hassan and his team are investigating whether blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations could contribute to improving the governance of commons-oriented communities, both online and offline. Their work has been showcased for tackling the impact of blockchain on governance, proposing alternatives to the current sharing economy, emerging forms of techno-social systems like NFTs, or giving relevance to gender issues in the field. Hassan was invited to present the project achievements in Harvard Kennedy School, MIT Media Lab, Harvard's Data Privacy Lab, Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Harvard's SEAS EconCS. British MP and Opposition Leader Ed Miliband showcased his research and its potential impact on policy."

Her work is described in Encounters with HCI Pioneers: A Personal History and Photo Journal. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from University of Wales in 1982, Master of Science degree ergonomics from University College London in 1983, and PhD in human-computer interaction from University of Wales in 1988. Rogers served as a professor of school of Cognitive and Computing Sciences at Sussex University from 1992 to 2003, Professor in Informatics from 2003 to 2006 at Indiana University, and Professor of HCI at Open University from 2006 to 2011. She is professor and director of The University College London Interaction Centre at University College London. She was Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator of over 30 research grants from EPSRC, ESRC, AHRC, EU and NIH. She is known for her work on iconic interface to human-centre AI and a research agenda of user engagement in ubiquitous computing. Rogers was a principal investigator for the ICRI project in collaboration with Intel. She led projects such as Visualising Mill Road, where they collected community data and visualized it as street art, and the Tidy Street project, visualising energy usage and efficiency from power meters. From 2000 to 2007, Rogers contributed to the UK Equator Project as a principal investigator, researching the relationship between physical and digital user experiences. One of the projects was \"Ambient Wood\", encouraging children to explore biological processes in a forest using wireless probes. Rogers worked on a project using ambient light to nudge people to take the stairs rather than the elevator. She worked on the Lambent Shopping Trolly Project, building a lambent display that clips onto any shopping trolley to nudge buying decisions. Rogers worked on an augmented reality (AR) project to \"try on\" makeup and see how this AR influences buying decisions. Her publications include:"

He is associated with the classical-liberal tradition of Hume, Mill, and Hayek. In his most cited work, Sugden explored how conventions of property, mutual aid, and voluntary supply of public goods can evolve spontaneously out of the interactions of self-interested individuals and can become moral norms. Sugden investigated a number of violations of the von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility axioms, and developed regret theory as an alternative with Graham Loomes. In support of this work, he developed a number of experimental methods to test theories of decision under risk. His work also deals with economic methods, in which he argues that economic models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world, but rather descriptions of imaginary worlds whose validity can only be inferred by how reasonable their predictions are. In The Community of Advantage, Sugden develops a contractarian approach to welfare economics that is based on opportunity sets and not individual preferences.  The shift from preferences to opportunity is partly motivated by recent experimental work indicating that individuals lack well-defined preferences.  In 2019, The Community of Advantage was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler Award for outstanding contribution in the field of the philosophy of the social sciences."

            "Marc A. Kastner (born November 20, 1945) is an American physicist and Donner Professor of Science and the former dean of the School of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently he is president of the Science Philanthropy Alliance. Kastner was born in Toronto, Ontario, on November 20, 1945. He completed his B.S. in chemistry in 1967, M.S. in 1969 and Ph.D. in physics in 1972 from the University of Chicago. Kastner was a Harvard Research Fellow from 1972 to 1973. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. He became Donner Professor of Science at MIT in 1989. He was appointed department head in February 1998. He served as the dean of the School of Science at MIT from 2007 to 2013. Kastner was a researcher on amorphous semiconductors. His early research focused on the relationship between chemical bonding and the electronic structure of defects in glasses. In 1990, his group at MIT discovered the single-electron transistor. It is a device in which electrostatic fields confine electrons to a small region of space inside a semiconductor. Single-electron transistors turn on and off again every time one electron is added. In an interview, he said that the discovery that a transistor could turn on and off again every time an electron was added to it was one of the most astounding and exciting experiences of his life. His recent research focused on the electronic properties of nanometer-size semiconductor structures and on the physics of high temperature (Tc ) superconductivity. Kastner received the 1995 David Adler Lectureship Award in the Field of Materials Physics from the American Physical Society for his research on semiconductors."

            "James Alexander Hendler (born April 2, 1957) is an artificial intelligence researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, United States, and one of the originators of the Semantic Web.  He is a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. Hendler completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree at Brown University in 1986 with a thesis on automated planning and scheduling.  He also has an MS (1981) in Cognitive Psychology from Southern Methodist University, a MSc (1983) from Brown University, and a BS (1978) from Yale University. Hendler's research interests are in the semantic web and artificial intelligence. Hendler held a longstanding position as professor at the University of Maryland where he was the Director of the Joint Institute for Knowledge Discovery and held joint appointments in the Department of Computer Science, the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and the Institute for Systems Research. Hendler was the Director for Semantic Web and Agent Technology at the Maryland Information and Network Dynamics Laboratory. He is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the British Computer Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the AAAS and the Association for Computing Machinery and the National Academy of Public Administration (United States). Hendler was co-author, with Tim Berners-Lee and Ora Lassila, of the article \"The Semantic Web\" which appeared in Scientific American in 2001. On June 14, 2006, James A. Hendler was appointed senior constellation professor of the Tetherless World Constellation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and he became a professor at that institute starting on January 1, 2007. Hendler has appointments in Computer, Web and Cognitive Sciences, and served as the  Dean for Information Technology and Web Science from 2009 to 2012.  In 2012 he became the Head of the Computer Science Department at RPI and in 2013 he became the Director of the RPI Institute for Data Exploration and Applications.  In 2017, he also became the Rensselaer lead of the joint RPI-IBM Center for Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics, (HEALS) a member of the IBM Artificial Intelligence Horizons Network. In 2019, Hendler was named  Director of the RPI-IBM Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration, a large joint project between IBM Research and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 2022, Hendler became the Founding Director of Rensselaer's Future of Computing Institute. Hendler helps lead the Tetherless World Constellation on increasing access to information at any time and place without the need for a \"tether\" to a specific computer or device. Researchers envision an increasingly web-accessible world in which personal digital assistants (PDAs), cameras, music-listening devices, cell phones, smartphones, laptops, and other technologies converge to offer the user interactive information and communication. Hendler is the former chair of the board of directors of the Web Science Trust and has been a visiting professor at Hebrew University, DeMontfort University, Bath Spa University, University of Edinburgh and an honorary professor at Wuhan University and University of Leicester. He is also the Editor in Chief Emeritus of IEEE Intelligent Systems and was the first computer scientist to serve on the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science. He is a former member of the US Air Force Science Advisory Board and a former Chief Scientist of the Information Systems Office at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  During his tenure there, he was responsible for projects such as the Control of Agent Based Systems (CoABS) program which led to the creation of other Agent-based projects: Taskable Agent Software Kit (TASK) and DARPA's Agent Markup Language  (DAML) - the latter of which was involved in funding the emerging Semantic Web area. Hendler served as an \"Internet Web Expert\" for the U.S. government, providing guidance to the Data.gov project, and in September 2013 he was appointed as the Open Data Advisor for NY State. In 2015, he was appointed a member of the US Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee (HSSTAC) and in 2016 appointed to the National Academies Board on Research Data and Information.

            "Stephen P. Boyd is an American professor and control theorist. He is the Samsung Professor of Engineering, Professor in Electrical Engineering, and professor by courtesy in Computer Science and Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University. He is also affiliated with Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME). In 2014, Boyd was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to engineering design and analysis via convex optimization. Boyd received an AB degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Harvard University in 1980, and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 under the supervision of Charles A. Desoer, S. Shankar Sastry and Leon Ong Chua. While at Berkeley, he was awarded a Hertz Fellowship (1982) and received the Hertz Thesis Prize (1985). In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, and in 2017, from the Universitu00e9 catholique de Louvain in Belgium. Boyd joined the faculty of Stanford University's Electrical Engineering department in 1985. He regularly teaches undergraduate courses in applied linear algebra and machine learning. During his time at Stanford, he has been recognized with several teaching awards, including the 2016 Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the school's highest teaching honor. He was awarded the 2017 IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal, in recognition of his efforts in education in the theory and application of optimization, which has sparked the writing of improved linear algebra and convex optimization textbooks. He has served as director of Stanford's Information Systems Laboratory, and as a visiting professor at universities including City University of Hong Kong, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. While at Stanford, he has consulted with numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, and founded one. His groups' CVXGEN software is used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to guide their autonomous precision landing. Boyd's primary research interests are convex optimization, especially applications in control, signal processing, machine learning, and finance. His PhD dissertation was on Volterra series descriptions of nonlinear circuits and devices. His primary focus then turned to automatic control systems, where he focused on applying convex optimization, specifically linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), to a variety of control system analysis and synthesis problems. With Craig Barratt, he authored Linear Controller Design: Limits of Performance in 1991. In 1994, Boyd and Laurent El Ghaoui, Eric Feron, and Ragu Balakrishnan authored the book Linear Matrix Inequalities in System & Control Theory. Around 1999, he and Lieven Vandenberghe developed a PhD-level course and wrote the book Convex Optimization to introduce and apply convex optimization to other fields. In 2005 he and Michael Grant developed the MATLAB open source software package CVX, which makes it easy to specify and solve convex optimization problems. This work earned them the 2012 Beale-Orchard-Hays Prize for Excellence in Computational Mathematical Programming. In 2012 he and Jacob Mattingley developed CVXGEN, which generates fast custom code for small, quadratic-programming-representable convex optimization problems, using an online interface. With minimal effort, it turns a mathematical problem description into a high-speed solver. Open source software packages developed by his research group are widely used, and include, Boyd is ranked top 10 scientist in the field of Engineering and Technology. Boyd co-founded and served as chief scientist of analog synthesis and intellectual property provider Barcelona Design, from its 1999 founding until it folded in 2005. He serves in an advisory capacity for BlackRock, an investment management corporation; Petuum, a machine learning platform for artificial intelligence; and H2O.ai, open source machine learning platform. He is also a co-inventor on 11 patents. On his personal website, which is visited more than 1.6 million times per year, he makes available papers, books, software, lecture notes and lecture videos."

            "Peter Richard Schreiner (born 17 November 1965 in Nuremberg, Germany) is a German chemist who is a professor at Justus Liebig University Giessen. As of 2022[update], his h-index is 73. Schreiner studied at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, where he received his diploma in 1992 (with Paul von Raguu00e9 Schleyer). He obtained his doctorate in organic chemistry in 1995 from the University of Georgia. From 1996 to 1999 he was a Liebig Fellow at the University of Gu00f6ttingen. While there he received the ADUC Prize for his work. From 1999 to 2002, he was associate professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Georgia. Since 2002 he has been a professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Giessen. From 2012 to 2015 he was vice president for Research and Promotion of Young Researchers at the University of Giessen. From 2006 to 2009 he was Dean of the Faculty of Biology and Chemistry. He has been a visiting professor at the Lorand Eu00f6tvu00f6s University in Budapest, at Technion in Haifa, at the University of Bordeaux, and at Stanford University. Schreiner was German Chemical Society (GDCh) President from 2020 to 2021. His research interests include organocatalysis, nanodiamonds (diamondoids), green chemistry, organic electronics, matrix isolation of reactive intermediates such as carbenes, and computational chemistry. He discovered the mechanism of tunnel control of reactions and demonstrated their diffusion, thus establishing a third driver of chemical reactions besides thermodynamic (energetically most favorable) and kinetic control (least barrier) (published in Science, 2011). He is one of the pioneers of organocatalysis, in which metal-containing catalysts are replaced by more environmentally friendly customized organic catalysts. Schreiner found a way to integrate nanodiamonds, which naturally occur in natural gas and petroleum but have nanoscale dimensions, into a coatings. In 1997 he helped develop the thiourea organocatalysis. Schreiner has been a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina since 2013. In 2015 he was elected to the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He is an honorary member of the Polish and Israeli Chemical Societies. In 2003 he received the Dirac Medal of the World Association of Theoretical and Computational Chemists and the Science Prize of the German Technion Society. For 2017 he was awarded the Adolf von Baeyer Medal of the GDCh. From 1995 to 1996 he was Project Coordinator of the Encyclopedia of Computational Chemistry. From 2011 he has been Associate Editor of the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry, from 2000 he has been Editor of the Journal of Computational Chemistry and since 2008 he has been Principal Editor of review journal WIRES-Computational Molecular Sciences."

            "Stephen P. Boyd is an American professor and control theorist. He is the Samsung Professor of Engineering, Professor in Electrical Engineering, and professor by courtesy in Computer Science and Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University. He is also affiliated with Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME). In 2014, Boyd was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to engineering design and analysis via convex optimization. Boyd received an AB degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Harvard University in 1980, and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 under the supervision of Charles A. Desoer, S. Shankar Sastry and Leon Ong Chua. While at Berkeley, he was awarded a Hertz Fellowship (1982) and received the Hertz Thesis Prize (1985). In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, and in 2017, from the Universitu00e9 catholique de Louvain in Belgium. Boyd joined the faculty of Stanford University's Electrical Engineering department in 1985. He regularly teaches undergraduate courses in applied linear algebra and machine learning. During his time at Stanford, he has been recognized with several teaching awards, including the 2016 Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the school's highest teaching honor. He was awarded the 2017 IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal, in recognition of his efforts in education in the theory and application of optimization, which has sparked the writing of improved linear algebra and convex optimization textbooks. He has served as director of Stanford's Information Systems Laboratory, and as a visiting professor at universities including City University of Hong Kong, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. While at Stanford, he has consulted with numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, and founded one. His groups' CVXGEN software is used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to guide their autonomous precision landing. Boyd's primary research interests are convex optimization, especially applications in control, signal processing, machine learning, and finance. His PhD dissertation was on Volterra series descriptions of nonlinear circuits and devices. His primary focus then turned to automatic control systems, where he focused on applying convex optimization, specifically linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), to a variety of control system analysis and synthesis problems. With Craig Barratt, he authored Linear Controller Design: Limits of Performance in 1991. In 1994, Boyd and Laurent El Ghaoui, Eric Feron, and Ragu Balakrishnan authored the book Linear Matrix Inequalities in System & Control Theory. Around 1999, he and Lieven Vandenberghe developed a PhD-level course and wrote the book Convex Optimization to introduce and apply convex optimization to other fields. In 2005 he and Michael Grant developed the MATLAB open source software package CVX, which makes it easy to specify and solve convex optimization problems. This work earned them the 2012 Beale-Orchard-Hays Prize for Excellence in Computational Mathematical Programming. In 2012 he and Jacob Mattingley developed CVXGEN, which generates fast custom code for small, quadratic-programming-representable convex optimization problems, using an online interface. With minimal effort, it turns a mathematical problem description into a high-speed solver. Open source software packages developed by his research group are widely used, and include, Boyd is ranked top 10 scientist in the field of Engineering and Technology. Boyd co-founded and served as chief scientist of analog synthesis and intellectual property provider Barcelona Design, from its 1999 founding until it folded in 2005. He serves in an advisory capacity for BlackRock, an investment management corporation; Petuum, a machine learning platform for artificial intelligence; and H2O.ai, open source machine learning platform. He is also a co-inventor on 11 patents. On his personal website, which is visited more than 1.6 million times per year, he makes available papers, books, software, lecture notes and lecture videos."

            "Partial Differential Equations International Federal Information Processes Irena Lasiecka (Polish pronunciation: [iu02c8ru025bna lau02c8u0255u025btu0361ska]; born February 4, 1948) is a Polish-American mathematician, a Distinguished University Professor of mathematics and chair of the mathematics department at the University of Memphis. She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory. Lasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\" Her specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization. Irena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study. After receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of. Optimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions. The work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations. Control Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\" In simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal, and feedback is the mapping from outputs to inputs. This can be applied to many facets of real-life, especially in various engineering fields that concentrate on the control of changes in their field. A good example of control theory applied to the real world is something as simple as a thermostat. The output in this system is temperature, and the control is turning the dial on or off, or to a higher or lower temperature. Lasiecka uses this theory to further understand partial differential equations. She attempts to answer the questions of how to take advantage of a model in order to improve the system's performance. This idea is paired her desire to understand mathematical solutions of the problems of well-posedness and regularity, stabilization and stability, and optimal control for finite or infinite horizon problems and existence and uniqueness of associated Riccati equations. In Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, Lasiecka studies this concept through waves and hyperbolic models. This book was written in order to \"help engineers and professionals involved in materials science and aerospace engineering to solve fundamental theoretical control problems. Applied mathematicians and theoretical engineers with an interest in the mathematical quantitative analysis will find this text useful.\"  Irena has written and edited numerous research journals and articles in addition to the above books."

            "Ian F. Akyildiz (born Ilhan Fuat Akyildiz on April 11, 1954, in Istanbul, Turkey) received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nu00fcrnberg, Germany, in 1978, 1981 and 1984, respectively. Currently, he is the President and CTO of the Truva Inc. since March 1989. He retired from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Tech in 2021 after almost 35 years service as Ken Byers Chair Professor in Telecommunications and Chair of the Telecom group. He serves on the advisory board of the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates since June 1, 2020. He is also an adjunct professor with the University of Helsinki since 2021, University of Iceland since 2020, and University of Cyprus since 2017. Dr. Akyildiz was the Megagrant Research Leader and Advisor to the Director of the Institute for Information Transmission Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow, Russia, (2018-2020). He is the Ken Byers Chair Professor Emeritus in Telecommunications, Past Chair of the Telecom group at the ECE and the Director of the Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1985u20132020). He founded the N3Cat (NanoNetworking Center) at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona, Spain, in 2008. He advised 48 PhD students, and 13 PostDocs, 52 visiting researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, and 15 Master students at Universitat Politu00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.[citation needed] His current research interests are in 6G/7G, Wireless Systems, TeraHertz Communication, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces, Nanonetworks, Internet of Space Things/CUBESATs, Internet of BioNanoThings, Molecular Communication and Underwater Communication. According to Google Scholar as of April 2023, his h-index is 135 and the total number of citations to his papers is 140+K.[citation needed] Akyildiz started his research work on queueing networks models in the early 1980s. His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled u201cMultiprocessor Systems with Process Communicationu201d where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur. His paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes. Based on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in. He published many other papers on queuing network models. These contributions lead him to obtain the IEEE Fellow rank in 1996, and in particular  to performance analysis of computer communication networks. In 1997 Ian Akyildiz with his colleagues at the YURIE  systems designed and implemented the first adaptive forward-error-correction solution on the link layer of their wireless ATM switch providing high reliability in wireless ATM networks with very low bit data rates used in battlefield scenarios. A patent for this solution was obtained in 2006 U.S. patent 7,058,027. A technical paper describing the link layer design on this low bit rate wireless ATM switch was published. The founder of the Yurie Systems, Jeong H. Kim, received the entrepreneur of the year award in 1997 and Yurie Systems was acquired by Lucent for 1 Billion US Dollars in 1998. Ian Akyildiz significantly contributed to mobility and resource management of 2G and 3G cellular systems in the 90s. He proposed many handoff management, location registration, and paging schemes for the design of 3G and 4G wireless systems, and all of his papers have been published in top notch journals and conferences between 1998 and 2000. His paper titled u201cMobility Management in Next-Generation Wireless Systemsu201d was invited to be included in Proceedings of IEEE, and is the most cited paper on mobility management in the literature, and became u201ctheu201d main reading material for the first course on mobile networks in many universities. His contributions to mobility and resource management gained him the ACM Fellow rank in 1997. Ian Akyildiz started to use the notion u201c4Gu201d wireless networks in 1999-2000 through his papers and keynote speeches. He clearly pointed out the requirements for heterogeneous 4G wireless systems, such as anywhere/anytime wireless connectivity with hundreds of Mbps bandwidth per mobile user for both data and multimedia services. Consequently, the first adaptive protocol suite framework for Next Generation Wireless Internet was supported by NSF (National Science Foundation) (2000-2005) NSF #:ANI-0117840. His early insights on the need to enable a single mobile terminal to seamlessly communicate over heterogeneous wireless access systems such as wireless LANs, 3G cellular networks, and satellite networks are seminal contributions to 4G systems.These ideas were the forerunner of the dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio networks. The culmination of his research work on this topic gained him the 2003 ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award for his \"pioneering contributions in the area of mobility and resource management for wireless communication networks\", in September 2003. Akyildiz, in collaboration and with support of NASA, developed several routing algorithms and a novel transport control protocol called TCP Peach  to realize practical satellite networks. He significantly contributed towards the development and realization of high altitude long operation (HALO) networks for providing broadband wireless network access which was implemented by Angel Technologies and Raytheon, exploited by invention disclosures (U.S. patent 6,756,937) and U.S. patent 7,027,769). HALO was the forerunner of the current UAVs and Drones and Cubesats research. Couple decades later many countries are working on the directions of the HALO project. This paper  is the first to comprehensively put forward the design principles and system reference model for HALO networks, which is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. With the extremely timely publication of the first and most comprehensive roadmap paper on wireless sensor networks, Akyildiz made this new research area known to the entire world. Many researchers, who work on sensor networks, has started by reading his paper. Hence, this publication has received more than 41,000 citations in 20 years. Moreover, this paper received the best tutorial paper award from IEEE Communications society in 2003. Thanks to his paper, the area has attracted significantly amplified attention and become focus of research and engineering efforts towards realizing wide range of sensor network applications.In 20 years, the research in this area has resulted in billions of dollars of investment from both government and private sector, educated thousands of students, and helped establish hundreds of companies. Dr. Akyildiz published many pioneering papers on wireless sensor networks. For example, in  the first reliable protocol (Event-to-Sink Reliable Transport -ESRT-) was introduced specifically tailored for the unique requirements and characteristics of wireless sensor networks. ESRT was devised based on the extremely novel and yet practical engineering notion of event-to-sink reliability, which leverages the inherent redundancy and spatio-temporal correlation in sensor networks to maximize the network lifetime. ESRT has also been taught in undergraduate and graduate level wireless networking courses at many universities. This work has been implemented in several simulation tools. The pioneering contributions to the field of wireless sensor networks was recognized as the IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award 2011. He is also the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks Technical Committee (AHSN TC) Technical Recognition Award based on his pioneering contributions to wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. Akyildiz was one of the first to introduce several advanced and next generation wireless sensor network paradigms and architectures to the research community including sensor and actor networks, multimedia sensor networks, underwater acoustic sensor networks, wireless underground sensor networks, underground magnetic sensor networks, along with the comprehensive list of open research issues and the first novel communication techniques. Preliminary version of this paper  received the best paper award from IEEE GlobeCom 2009 conference. The paper  became the flagpole paper that every researcher reads first as the first initiation into the field of CR networks during the heyday of the CR networks. The paper  had major impact as it is the first work which demonstrated the existence of optimal sensing parameters theoretically and developed the framework to support this optimality in real network environments. This paper identified the interference model for CR, well-motivated from the limitation of communication hardware that RF front-ends cannot differentiate between the transmissions of primary and secondary users. It developed a practical spectrum sensing solution, where an optimal observation time and a transmission time are determined to maximize sensing efficiency while satisfying interference limits. The paper  is the first research work that identifies the practical issues and derives possible solutions when extending the CR concept to cellular mobile networks. Specifically, this paper defined two mobility types in the CR cellular networks, user mobility and spectrum mobility. Akyildiz and his PhD students coined the word u201cCRAHNsu201d for the first time in, which is used as a standard terminology by the research community in the meantime. Specifically, this paper looked at the network architectures, where multiple nodes are not associated with a single controller (hence, called CR ad hoc networks or CRAHNs). Many practical networks can be built on top of such distributed architectures for consumer, military and disaster scenarios, with unpredictable spectrum availability. CRAHNS must operate in a dynamic environment where locations, spectrum availability, and neighboring forwarding nodes can change over time, and so are completely different from cellular networks. All these pioneering contributions lead to receive the prestigious IEEE ComSoc TCCN Recognition Award in 2017 by the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Cognitive Networks (TCCN) with citation \"for pioneering contributions to spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing algorithms and communication protocols for cognitive radio networks\". From the nano-device perspective, Akyildiz and his student Jornet proposed for the first time and investigated the use of graphene to develop nano-antennas for electromagnetic (EM) communication in nanonetworks in. This paper showed that, by using a narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR), an antenna just a few hundreds of nanometers long and tens of nanometers wide could radiate EM waves in the Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz). This framework is used to characterize the propagation characteristics of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in graphene. This work has become a foundation stone for EM nanonetworks and a US Patent was obtained for this technology in 2017. Akyildiz and Jornet also proposed a plasmonic nano-transceiver that intrinsically operate in the THz band in where the basic idea is based on the integration of III-V High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMT) with graphene in. In 2016, a US Patent is obtained for this technology. Akyildiz and his PhD student Jornet also developed very large plasmonic nano-antenna Planar Array with 32x32 (in total of 1024) elements which is called \"Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems\" in  and a patent was issued for this idea in 2017. While nanonetworks do not operate based on radio frequency spectrums, they mainly exploit networking paradigms which are fundamentally different yet u201cwirelessu201d such as molecular communication, where the information is coded and communicated by molecules as explored in  and the term u201cInternet of BioNanoThings: was coined in the paper  for the first time. Akyildiz and his student Pierobon also developed one of the first realistic molecular communication channel models and capacity analysis for molecular communication in. Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as one of the key wireless technologies of the next decade. The THz band will help to overcome the spectrum scarcity problems and capacity limitations of current wireless networks, by providing an unprecedentedly large bandwidth. In addition, THz-band communication will enable a plethora of long-awaited applications ranging from instantaneous massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks, to ultra-high-definition content streaming over mobile devices in 6G systems. The THz-band channel was investigated in  and the first channel model was developed for this almost unexplored frequency range. The peculiarities of the channel were captured by utilizing radiative transfer theory to account for the absorption from different types of gaseous molecules. In addition, he analytically calculated the channel capacity of the THz band for different medium compositions and power allocation schemes. Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. A radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments was first introduced in the VISORSURF project. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of two-dimensional metamaterials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation. Multiple tiles coat objects such as walls, furniture, and other objects in indoor and outdoor settings. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile to best fit the needs of communicating devices. A patent was acquired in January 2020. A novel cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, called the Internet of Space Things/CubeSats (IoST) is introduced in. IoST expands the functionalities of traditional IoT, by not only providing an always-available satellite backhaul network, but also by contributing real-time satellite-captured information and, more importantly, performing integration of on the ground data and satellite information to enable new applications. The fundamental building block for IoST is a new generation of nano-satellites known as CubeSats, which are augmented with Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) solutions. He is the Founder and Editor in Chief of the newly established of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) Journal on Future and Evolving Technologies (ITU-J FET) since August 2020.

He is active in the field of programming languages and mechanisms to support the flexible composition of high-level, component-based abstractions, tools and environments to support the understanding, analysis and transformation of software systems to more flexible, component-based designs, secure software engineering, and requirement engineering to support stakeholders and developers to have moldable and clear requirements. He has led the Software Composition Group at the University of Berne since 1994 to date (December 2011). Nierstrasz was born in Laren, the Netherlands.[circular reference] He lived there for three years and then his parents, Thomas Oscar Duyck (1930--) and Meta Maria van den Bos (1936-1988) moved to Canada. He developed an early interest in Mathematics and Computer Science. He pursued his Bachelor studies in the Departments of Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo in 1979. He enrolled for the master studies in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto in 1981. There, he continued for his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. D. Tsichritzis. During his postgraduate work in the university, Nierstrasz worked on the `Message Flow Analysis'. He finished his Ph.D. in 1984 and then worked at the Forth Institute of Computer Science in Crete for one year. Since 1985, Nierstrasz has lived in Switzerland. He was a member of the Object System Group at the Center Universitaire d' Informatique of the University of Geneva, Switzerland (1985-1994).  He met there his wife, Angela Margiotta Nierstrasz. They married in May 1994. In late 1994, he moved to Bern, Switzerland to work as a professor.

In 2020 he was named a Fellow of the ACM. Menczer holds a Laurea in physics from the Sapienza University of Rome and a PhD in computer science and cognitive science from the University of California, San Diego. He used to be an assistant professor of management sciences at the University of Iowa, and a fellow-at-large of the Santa Fe Institute. At Indiana University Bloomington since 2003, he served as division chair in the Luddy School in 2009u20132011. Menczer has been the recipient of Fulbright, Rotary Foundation, and NATO fellowships, and a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation. He holds editorial positions for the journals Network Science, EPJ Data Science, PeerJ Computer Science, and HKS Misinformation Review. He has served as program or track chair for various conferences including The Web Conference and the ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media. He was general chair of the ACM Web Science 2014 Conference and general co-chair of the NetSci 2017 Conference. Menczer's research focuses on Web science, social networks, social media, social computation, Web mining, data science, distributed and intelligent Web applications, and modeling of complex information networks. He introduced the idea of topical and adaptive Web crawlers, a specialized and intelligent type of Web crawler. Menczer is also known for his work on social phishing, a type of phishing attacks that leverage friendship information from social networks, yielding over 70% success rate in experiments (with Markus Jakobsson); semantic similarity measures for information and social networks; models of complex information and social networks (with Alessandro Vespignani and others); search engine censorship; and search engine bias. The group led by Menczer has analyzed and modeled how memes, information, and misinformation spread through social media in domains such as the Occupy movement, the Gezi Park protests, and political elections. Data and tools from Menczer's lab have aided in finding the roots of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the disinformation campaign targeting the White Helmets, and in taking down voter-suppression bots on Twitter. Menczer and coauthors have also found a link between online COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Analysis by Menczer's team demonstrated the echo-chamber structure of information-diffusion networks on Twitter during the 2010 United States elections. The team found that conservatives almost exclusively retweeted other conservatives while liberals retweeted other liberals. Ten years later, this work received the Test of Time Award at the 15th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). As these patterns of polarization and segregation persist, Menczer's team has developed a model that shows how social influence and unfollowing accelerate the emergence of online echo chambers. Menczer and colleagues have advanced the understanding of information virality, and in particular the prediction of what memes will go viral based on the structure of early diffusion networks and how competition for finite attention helps explain virality patterns. In a 2018 paper in Nature Human Behaviour, Menczer and coauthors used a model to show that when agents in a social networks share information under conditions of high information load and/or low attention, the correlation between quality and popularity of information in the system decreases. An erroneous analysis in the paper suggested that this effect alone would be sufficient to explain why fake news are as likely to go viral as legitimate news on Facebook. When the authors discovered the error, they retracted the paper. Following influential publications on the detection of astroturfing and social bots, Menczer and his team have studied the complex interplay between cognitive, social, and algorithmic factors that contribute to the vulnerability of social media platforms and people to manipulation, and focused on developing tools to counter such abuse. Their bot detection tool, Botometer, was used to assess the prevalence of social bots and their sharing activity. Their tool to visualize the spread of low-credibility content, Hoaxy, was used in conjunction with Botometer to reveal the key role played by social bots in spreading low-credibility content during the 2016 United States presidential election. Menczer's team also studied perceptions of partisan political bots, finding that Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots. Using bot probes on Twitter, Menczer and coauthors demonstrated a conservative political bias on the platform. As social media have increased their countermeasures against malicious automated accounts, Menczer and coauthors have shown that coordinated campaigns by inauthentic accounts continue to threaten information integrity on social media, and developed a framework to detect these coordinated networks. They also demonstrated new forms of social media manipulation by which bad actors can grow influence networks and hide high-volume of content with which they flood the network. Menczer and colleagues have shown that political audience diversity can be used as an indicator of news source reliability in algorithmic ranking. The textbook A First Course in Network Science by Menczer, Fortunato, and Davis was published by Cambridge University Press in 2020. The textbook has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, and Korean."

            "Magnus B. Egerstedt (born June 28, 1971) is a Swedish-American roboticist who is the Dean of the Henry Samueli School of Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. He was formerly the Steve C. Chaddick School Chair and Professor at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. Egerstedt is a major contributor to the theory of hybrid and discrete event systems, and in particular, the control of multi-agent systems. Magnus Egerstedt was born in Tu00e4by Municipality, Stockholm, Sweden in 1971. He received his B.A. from Stockholm University in Theoretical Philosophy in 1996, specializing in language philosophy and with a thesis titled Implicit Knowledge and Public Mathematical Meaning, while simultaneously attending the Royal Institute of Technology, where he received in 1996 an M.S. in engineering physics. During this period, Egerstedt visited Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, and completed his M.S. thesis A Model of the Combined Planar Motion of the Human Head and Eye. In 2000, Egerstedt completed a Ph.D. in applied mathematics under the advisement of Xiaoming Hu and Anders Lindquist for the thesis Motion Planning and Control of Mobile Robots. At KTH, Egerstedt was affiliated with (and the first graduate from) the Center for Autonomous Systems. In 1998, Egerstedt was a visiting scholar at the Robotics Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, where he collaborated with Shankar S. Sastry on the hybrid control of mobile robotics. From 2000 to 2001, he was a postdoctoral fellow under Roger W. Brockett at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, focusing on formal methods for robot control. Egerstedt joined the Georgia Institute of Technology as a faculty member in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2001, where he has held the positions of Schlumberger Professor (2013u20132016), Julian T. Hightower Chair in Systems and Controls (2016u20132018), and Associate Chair for Research (2014u20132016). In August 2018, he was appointed as the Steve W. Chaddick School Chair of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Egerstedt is also holds adjunct appointments in the School of Interactive Computing, the Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, and the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2016, Egerstedt was named the Executive Director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, a position he held for two years. In 2017, Egerstedt launched the Robotarium, a swarm-robotic research testbed whose goal is to provide access to a state-of-the-art test facility to researchers around the globe. In July 2021, Egerstedt joined the University of California, Irvine, where he is the Dean of the Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Egerstedt has earned a number of teaching and research awards and honors during his career: The Robotarium is a remotely accessible swarm robotics testbed designed and developed by Magnus Egerstedt at Georgia Tech. The Robotarium provides researchers working on swarm robotics access to both ground and aerial robots. Since its launch in August 2017, over 200 research groups from all continents except Antarctica have used the Robotarium. Egerstedt has authored over 400 research papers in the areas of robotics and control, including the books:"

            "Henrik Iskov Christensen (born July 16, 1962 in Frederikshavn, Denmark) is a Danish roboticist and Professor of Computer Science at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. He is also the Director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC San Diego. Prior to UC San Diego, he was a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. At Georgia Tech, Christensen served as the founding director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM@GT) and the KUKA Chair of Robotics. Previously, Christensen was the Founding Chairman of European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and an IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Distinguished Lecturer in Robotics. Christensen received his Certificate of Apprenticeship in Mechanical Engineering from the Frederikshavn Technical School, Denmark in 1981. He received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Aalborg University in 1987 and 1990, respectively. His doctoral thesis Aspects of Real Time Image Sequence Analysis was advised by Erik Granum. After receiving his Ph.D., Christensen held teaching and research positions at Aalborg University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Royal Institute of Technology. In 2006, Christensen accepted a part-time position at the Georgia Institute of Technology as a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and the KUKA Chair of Robotics, and transitioned to full-time in early 2007. At Georgia Tech, Christensen served as the founding director of the Center for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (RIM@GT), an interdepartmental research units consists of the College of Computing, College of Engineering, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). During his tenure, RIM@GT experienced an unprecedented growth, including (as of 2008) 36 faculty members as well as a dedicated interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Robotics. He joined UC San Diego the fall of 2016 to be the director of the UC San Diego Contextual Robotics Institute. The institute does research on robots in the context of empowering people in their daily lives from work over leisure to domestic tasks. An important consideration is the context in which the robot is to perform its tasks. In 2007, Christensen led Georgia Tech's team in the DARPA Urban Grand Challenge as the principal investigator. The 2007 UGC was the third installment of the DARPA Grand Challenges (in 2004 and 2005), and took place on November 3, 2007 at the site of the now-closed George Air Force Base (currently used as Southern California Logistics Airport), in Victorville, California. The course involved a 96xa0km (60xa0mi) urban area course, to be completed in less than 6 hours while obeying all traffic regulations."

            "Ian F. Akyildiz (born Ilhan Fuat Akyildiz on April 11, 1954, in Istanbul, Turkey) received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nu00fcrnberg, Germany, in 1978, 1981 and 1984, respectively. Currently, he is the President and CTO of the Truva Inc. since March 1989. He retired from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Tech in 2021 after almost 35 years service as Ken Byers Chair Professor in Telecommunications and Chair of the Telecom group. He serves on the advisory board of the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates since June 1, 2020. He is also an adjunct professor with the University of Helsinki since 2021, University of Iceland since 2020, and University of Cyprus since 2017. Dr. Akyildiz was the Megagrant Research Leader and Advisor to the Director of the Institute for Information Transmission Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow, Russia, (2018-2020). He is the Ken Byers Chair Professor Emeritus in Telecommunications, Past Chair of the Telecom group at the ECE and the Director of the Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1985u20132020). He founded the N3Cat (NanoNetworking Center) at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona, Spain, in 2008. He advised 48 PhD students, and 13 PostDocs, 52 visiting researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, and 15 Master students at Universitat Politu00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.[citation needed] His current research interests are in 6G/7G, Wireless Systems, TeraHertz Communication, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces, Nanonetworks, Internet of Space Things/CUBESATs, Internet of BioNanoThings, Molecular Communication and Underwater Communication. According to Google Scholar as of April 2023, his h-index is 135 and the total number of citations to his papers is 140+K.[citation needed] Akyildiz started his research work on queueing networks models in the early 1980s. His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled u201cMultiprocessor Systems with Process Communicationu201d where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur. His paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes. Based on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in. He published many other papers on queuing network models. These contributions lead him to obtain the IEEE Fellow rank in 1996, and in particular  to performance analysis of computer communication networks. In 1997 Ian Akyildiz with his colleagues at the YURIE  systems designed and implemented the first adaptive forward-error-correction solution on the link layer of their wireless ATM switch providing high reliability in wireless ATM networks with very low bit data rates used in battlefield scenarios. A patent for this solution was obtained in 2006 U.S. patent 7,058,027. A technical paper describing the link layer design on this low bit rate wireless ATM switch was published. The founder of the Yurie Systems, Jeong H. Kim, received the entrepreneur of the year award in 1997 and Yurie Systems was acquired by Lucent for 1 Billion US Dollars in 1998. Ian Akyildiz significantly contributed to mobility and resource management of 2G and 3G cellular systems in the 90s. He proposed many handoff management, location registration, and paging schemes for the design of 3G and 4G wireless systems, and all of his papers have been published in top notch journals and conferences between 1998 and 2000. His paper titled u201cMobility Management in Next-Generation Wireless Systemsu201d was invited to be included in Proceedings of IEEE, and is the most cited paper on mobility management in the literature, and became u201ctheu201d main reading material for the first course on mobile networks in many universities. His contributions to mobility and resource management gained him the ACM Fellow rank in 1997. Ian Akyildiz started to use the notion u201c4Gu201d wireless networks in 1999-2000 through his papers and keynote speeches. He clearly pointed out the requirements for heterogeneous 4G wireless systems, such as anywhere/anytime wireless connectivity with hundreds of Mbps bandwidth per mobile user for both data and multimedia services. Consequently, the first adaptive protocol suite framework for Next Generation Wireless Internet was supported by NSF (National Science Foundation) (2000-2005) NSF #:ANI-0117840. His early insights on the need to enable a single mobile terminal to seamlessly communicate over heterogeneous wireless access systems such as wireless LANs, 3G cellular networks, and satellite networks are seminal contributions to 4G systems.These ideas were the forerunner of the dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio networks. The culmination of his research work on this topic gained him the 2003 ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award for his \"pioneering contributions in the area of mobility and resource management for wireless communication networks\", in September 2003. Akyildiz, in collaboration and with support of NASA, developed several routing algorithms and a novel transport control protocol called TCP Peach  to realize practical satellite networks. He significantly contributed towards the development and realization of high altitude long operation (HALO) networks for providing broadband wireless network access which was implemented by Angel Technologies and Raytheon, exploited by invention disclosures (U.S. patent 6,756,937) and U.S. patent 7,027,769). HALO was the forerunner of the current UAVs and Drones and Cubesats research. Couple decades later many countries are working on the directions of the HALO project. This paper  is the first to comprehensively put forward the design principles and system reference model for HALO networks, which is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. With the extremely timely publication of the first and most comprehensive roadmap paper on wireless sensor networks, Akyildiz made this new research area known to the entire world. Many researchers, who work on sensor networks, has started by reading his paper. Hence, this publication has received more than 41,000 citations in 20 years. Moreover, this paper received the best tutorial paper award from IEEE Communications society in 2003. Thanks to his paper, the area has attracted significantly amplified attention and become focus of research and engineering efforts towards realizing wide range of sensor network applications.In 20 years, the research in this area has resulted in billions of dollars of investment from both government and private sector, educated thousands of students, and helped establish hundreds of companies. Dr. Akyildiz published many pioneering papers on wireless sensor networks. For example, in  the first reliable protocol (Event-to-Sink Reliable Transport -ESRT-) was introduced specifically tailored for the unique requirements and characteristics of wireless sensor networks. ESRT was devised based on the extremely novel and yet practical engineering notion of event-to-sink reliability, which leverages the inherent redundancy and spatio-temporal correlation in sensor networks to maximize the network lifetime. ESRT has also been taught in undergraduate and graduate level wireless networking courses at many universities. This work has been implemented in several simulation tools. The pioneering contributions to the field of wireless sensor networks was recognized as the IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award 2011. He is also the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks Technical Committee (AHSN TC) Technical Recognition Award based on his pioneering contributions to wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. Akyildiz was one of the first to introduce several advanced and next generation wireless sensor network paradigms and architectures to the research community including sensor and actor networks, multimedia sensor networks, underwater acoustic sensor networks, wireless underground sensor networks, underground magnetic sensor networks, along with the comprehensive list of open research issues and the first novel communication techniques. Preliminary version of this paper  received the best paper award from IEEE GlobeCom 2009 conference. The paper  became the flagpole paper that every researcher reads first as the first initiation into the field of CR networks during the heyday of the CR networks. The paper  had major impact as it is the first work which demonstrated the existence of optimal sensing parameters theoretically and developed the framework to support this optimality in real network environments. This paper identified the interference model for CR, well-motivated from the limitation of communication hardware that RF front-ends cannot differentiate between the transmissions of primary and secondary users. It developed a practical spectrum sensing solution, where an optimal observation time and a transmission time are determined to maximize sensing efficiency while satisfying interference limits. The paper  is the first research work that identifies the practical issues and derives possible solutions when extending the CR concept to cellular mobile networks. Specifically, this paper defined two mobility types in the CR cellular networks, user mobility and spectrum mobility. Akyildiz and his PhD students coined the word u201cCRAHNsu201d for the first time in, which is used as a standard terminology by the research community in the meantime. Specifically, this paper looked at the network architectures, where multiple nodes are not associated with a single controller (hence, called CR ad hoc networks or CRAHNs). Many practical networks can be built on top of such distributed architectures for consumer, military and disaster scenarios, with unpredictable spectrum availability. CRAHNS must operate in a dynamic environment where locations, spectrum availability, and neighboring forwarding nodes can change over time, and so are completely different from cellular networks. All these pioneering contributions lead to receive the prestigious IEEE ComSoc TCCN Recognition Award in 2017 by the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Cognitive Networks (TCCN) with citation \"for pioneering contributions to spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing algorithms and communication protocols for cognitive radio networks\". From the nano-device perspective, Akyildiz and his student Jornet proposed for the first time and investigated the use of graphene to develop nano-antennas for electromagnetic (EM) communication in nanonetworks in. This paper showed that, by using a narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR), an antenna just a few hundreds of nanometers long and tens of nanometers wide could radiate EM waves in the Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz). This framework is used to characterize the propagation characteristics of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in graphene. This work has become a foundation stone for EM nanonetworks and a US Patent was obtained for this technology in 2017. Akyildiz and Jornet also proposed a plasmonic nano-transceiver that intrinsically operate in the THz band in where the basic idea is based on the integration of III-V High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMT) with graphene in. In 2016, a US Patent is obtained for this technology. Akyildiz and his PhD student Jornet also developed very large plasmonic nano-antenna Planar Array with 32x32 (in total of 1024) elements which is called \"Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems\" in  and a patent was issued for this idea in 2017. While nanonetworks do not operate based on radio frequency spectrums, they mainly exploit networking paradigms which are fundamentally different yet u201cwirelessu201d such as molecular communication, where the information is coded and communicated by molecules as explored in  and the term u201cInternet of BioNanoThings: was coined in the paper  for the first time. Akyildiz and his student Pierobon also developed one of the first realistic molecular communication channel models and capacity analysis for molecular communication in. Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as one of the key wireless technologies of the next decade. The THz band will help to overcome the spectrum scarcity problems and capacity limitations of current wireless networks, by providing an unprecedentedly large bandwidth. In addition, THz-band communication will enable a plethora of long-awaited applications ranging from instantaneous massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks, to ultra-high-definition content streaming over mobile devices in 6G systems. The THz-band channel was investigated in  and the first channel model was developed for this almost unexplored frequency range. The peculiarities of the channel were captured by utilizing radiative transfer theory to account for the absorption from different types of gaseous molecules. In addition, he analytically calculated the channel capacity of the THz band for different medium compositions and power allocation schemes. Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. A radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments was first introduced in the VISORSURF project. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of two-dimensional metamaterials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation. Multiple tiles coat objects such as walls, furniture, and other objects in indoor and outdoor settings. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile to best fit the needs of communicating devices. A patent was acquired in January 2020. A novel cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, called the Internet of Space Things/CubeSats (IoST) is introduced in. IoST expands the functionalities of traditional IoT, by not only providing an always-available satellite backhaul network, but also by contributing real-time satellite-captured information and, more importantly, performing integration of on the ground data and satellite information to enable new applications. The fundamental building block for IoST is a new generation of nano-satellites known as CubeSats, which are augmented with Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) solutions. He is the Founder and Editor in Chief of the newly established of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) Journal on Future and Evolving Technologies (ITU-J FET) since August 2020.

            "Alessandra Costanzo is an Italian electrical engineer specializing in microwave engineering, microwave circuits, and wireless power transfer. She is a professor at the University of Bologna. Costanzo earned a laurea (master's degree) in electrical engineering, through a 5-year course of study, in 1987 at the University of Bologna. In 1989, through a national competition, she won a permanent research position at the University of Bologna, bypassing the need to earn a doctorate. She became an associate professor in the faculty of engineering there in 2001 and full professor in the Department of Electrical Energy and Information Engineering in 2018. From 2015 to 2017 she chaired the Technical Committee on Wireless Power Transmission and Conversion of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society. In 2017, Costanzo became a distinguished lecturer of the IEEE Council on radio-frequency identification (CRFID). In 2022, Costanzo was named an IEEE Fellow \"for contributions to nonlinear electromagnetic co-design of RF and microwave circuits\"."

            "Maxime Crochemore (born 1947) is a French computer scientist known for his numerous contributions to algorithms on strings. He is currently[when?] a professor at King's College London. Crochemore earned his doctorate (PhD) in 1978 and his Doctorat d'u00e9tat (DSc) in 1983 from the University of Rouen. He was a professor at Paris 13 University in 1985u20131989, and moved to a professorship at Paris Diderot University in 1989. In 2002u20132007, Crochemore was a senior research fellow at King's College London, where he is a professor since 2007. Since 2007, he is also a professor emeritus at the University of Marne-la-Vallu00e9e.[citation needed] Crochemore holds an honorary doctorate (2014) from the University of Helsinki. A festschrift in his honour was published in 2009 as a special issue of Theoretical Computer Science. Crochemore published over 100 journal papers on string algorithms. He in particular introduced new algorithms for pattern matching, string indexing and text compression. His work received a significant number of academic citations. Crochemore has co-authored three well-known scientific monographs on the design of algorithms for string processing: \"Text Algorithms\" (1994; jointly with Wojciech Rytter), \"Jewels of Stringology\" (2002, jointly with Wojciech Rytter), and \"Algorithms on Strings\" (2007, jointly with Christophe Hancart and Thierry Lecroq)."

            "Ioannis A. Kakadiaris is a Greek-born American computer scientist who has developed an identity verification system at the University of Houston. He is a Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen University Professor of Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Houston, a position to which he was appointed in 2011. Ioannis A. Kakadiaris received his BSc in physics (1989) from the University of Athens. After moving to the United States, he received MSc in computer science (1991) from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and his PhD in computer science (1997) from the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). The system works by extracting a unique biometric signature of a person's face based on combination of 3D shape, texture, infrared, and time variables. While earlier face recognition methods have focused on appearance - capturing, representing, and matching facial characteristics as they appear on 2D images in the visible spectrum, the proposed URxD system uses a webcam to capture a continuous video stream which is used to detect whether a person is facing the 3D camera, and if the subject is facing the camera relatively still for more than two seconds, the system triggers the optical scanner and the 3D data are captured. It can also determine whether the person is wearing glasses. The system has achieved the best published results when tried to 4,007 datasets as a part of the international face recognition Grand Challenge organized by NIST in 2007.[citation needed]"

            "Luis M. Rocha is the George J. Klir Professor of Systems Science at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science, Binghamton University (State University of New York). He has been director of the NSF-NRT Complex Networks and Systems graduate Program in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He is also director of the Center for Social and Biomedical Complexity, between Binghamton University and Indiana University, Bloomington, a Fulbright Scholar, and Principal Investigator at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal. His research is on complex systems and networks, computational and systems biology, biomedical complexity and digital health, and computational intelligence (including Artificial Life and Embodied Cognition). He was born in Luanda, Angola, moving to Lisbon, Portugal in his teens and completing an Licentiate (B.A. plus M.S.) in Mechanical and Systems Engineering at the Instituto Superior Tu00e9cnico. He received his Ph.D in Systems Science in 1997 from the  Binghamton University. From 1998 to 2004 he was a staff scientist at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he founded and led a Complex Systems Modeling Team during 1998-2002, and was part of the Santa Fe Institute research community. He has been the director of the NSF-NRT Interdisciplinary Training Program in Complex Networks and Systems, and Professor of Informatics in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, where he was a member of the advisory council of the Indiana University Network Science Institute, and core faculty of the Cognitive Science Program.  From 2005 to 2015 he was the director of the  Computational Biology Collaboratorium and in the Direction of the PhD program in Computational Biology at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, where he remains a Principal Investigator. He has organized the Tenth International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems (Alife X) and the Ninth European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2007). Dr. Rocha studies the systems properties of natural and artificial systems which enable them to adapt and evolve. He has approached this general topic by investigating how information and redundancy are fundamental for controlling the behavior and evolutionary capabilities of complex systems, as well as abstracting principles from natural systems to produce adaptive information technology. Accepting Von Neumann's principle of self-replication and Turing's universal computation as a general principle for generating open-ended complexity that encompasses Natural Selection, Dr. Rocha has developed the work of Howard Pattee, Sydney Brenner, and others who regard computation and information as fundamental to understanding life, cognition and other complex systems (a good overview is Gleick's Book). From this viewpoint, he has approached several questions: how do cells and collectives of cells compute? Is language an evolutionary system operating under the same principle? Can artificial systems implement the same principle? Namely, can collective intelligence on the web become a super-organism implementing this principle?  From these questions, he has worked on various specific research projects ranging from Biomedical Literature Mining and Social Media Mining to understanding redundancy, robustness, modularity and control in Complex Networks, Collective Intelligence on the Web and in Social Systems, and Agent-based models of Evolutionary Systems such as RNA Editing and Artificial Immune Systems. Rocha is a proponent of embodied and situated cognition and has defended the grounded epistemological stance of evolutionary constructivism. He is a proponent of the view that the threshold of complexity required for open-ended evolution requires an interplay between symbolic memory and dynamical machinery, i.e. a strict genotype-phenotype separation. This idea has been labeled  semiotic closure and is generally understood to fit in the area of biosemiotics. He has defended that this principle of organization is at play in cognition and human collective behavior, having developed web technology to implement the principle. In addition to scientific work often mentioned in the media, he regularly publishes opinion articles in the popular media to disseminate scientific thinking."

            "Odest Chadwicke Jenkins (born 1975) is an American computer scientist who is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

            "Partial Differential Equations International Federal Information Processes Irena Lasiecka (Polish pronunciation: [iu02c8ru025bna lau02c8u0255u025btu0361ska]; born February 4, 1948) is a Polish-American mathematician, a Distinguished University Professor of mathematics and chair of the mathematics department at the University of Memphis. She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory. Lasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\" Her specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization. Irena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study. After receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of. Optimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions. The work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations. Control Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\" In simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal, and feedback is the mapping from outputs to inputs. This can be applied to many facets of real-life, especially in various engineering fields that concentrate on the control of changes in their field. A good example of control theory applied to the real world is something as simple as a thermostat. The output in this system is temperature, and the control is turning the dial on or off, or to a higher or lower temperature. Lasiecka uses this theory to further understand partial differential equations. She attempts to answer the questions of how to take advantage of a model in order to improve the system's performance. This idea is paired her desire to understand mathematical solutions of the problems of well-posedness and regularity, stabilization and stability, and optimal control for finite or infinite horizon problems and existence and uniqueness of associated Riccati equations. In Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, Lasiecka studies this concept through waves and hyperbolic models. This book was written in order to \"help engineers and professionals involved in materials science and aerospace engineering to solve fundamental theoretical control problems. Applied mathematicians and theoretical engineers with an interest in the mathematical quantitative analysis will find this text useful.\"  Irena has written and edited numerous research journals and articles in addition to the above books."

Richtmyer Prize (1997) David Turnbull Prize (1998) Distinguished Teacheru2013Scholar Prize (2001) Memory Ride Prize for Alzheimer Research (2001) Dwight Nicholson Medal (2003) Teresiana Medal (2004) Boltzmann Medal (2004) Zenith Fellow Award of the Alzheimer Association (2005) Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize (2008) Senior Award, European Complex Systems Society (2014) Harry Eugene Stanley (born March 28, 1941) is an American physicist and University Professor at Boston University. He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics. Stanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962. He performed biological physics research with Max Delbru00fcck in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967. Stanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph  Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971. Stanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden. Stanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nu00e0 infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks. His seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed with Texeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume [H. E. Stanley and J. Teixeira, u201cInterpretation of The Unusual Behavior of H2O and D2O at Low Temperatures: Tests of a Percolation Modelu201d J. Chem. Phys. 73, 3404u20133422 (1980)]. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of wateru2019s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford. Stanley coined the term u2018econophysicsu2019 in 1994 to denote the field of physics dealing with economic phenomena. His group has found empirical laws governing economic fluctuations, and proposed statistical mechanics models to explain their origins.   The ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201. Stanley is committed to education at all levels, from high school to graduate studies.  He has served as thesis advisor to 114 Ph.D. students and has collaborated with 211 postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. He is also active in worldwide efforts for achieving gender balance in the physical sciences. Stanley has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2004), the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.  He is an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Physical Society. He is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), and at Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest, Hungary).  Stanley awarded the 2004 APS Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, \"For his extraordinary contributions to human rights, for his initiatives on behalf of female physicists, and for his caring and supportive relationship with those who have worked in his laboratory.\" For his contributions to phase transitions Stanley received the 2004 Boltzmann Medal, awarded by International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the American Physical Society 2008 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize. He was awarded the Teresiana Medal in Complex Systems Research given by the University of Pavia.  He also received the Distinguished Teaching Scholar  Director's Award from the National Science Foundation, the Nicholson Medal for Human Outreach from the American Physical Society, a Guggenheim Fellowship (1979), the David Turnbull Prize from the Materials Research Society (1998), a BP Venture Research Award, the Floyd K. Richtmyer Memorial Lectureship Award (1997), the Memory Ride Award for Alzheimer Research, and the Massachusetts Professor of the Year awarded by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Stanley has received nine Doctorates Honoris Causa, from Bar-Ilan University Ramat Gan, (Israel), Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest). University of Liu00e8ge (Belgium),[citation needed] University of Dortmund, University of Wroclaw, Northwestern University, University of Messina, University of Leicester, and the IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca."

            "Gary Nance Smith (born 1945) is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Economics at Pomona College. His research on financial markets statistical reasoning, and artificial intelligence, often involves stock market anomalies, statistical fallacies, and the misuse of data have been widely cited. Smith earned his B. S. in mathematics from Harvey Mudd College and enrolled in Yale Universityu2019s graduate economics program. After taking classes from James Tobin and William Brainard, he decided to focus on macroeconomics. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1971 and was hired as an assistant professor. In a demonstration of the law of comparative advantage, Smith taught the first-year graduate course in macroeconomics while Tobin taught the first-year graduate course in microeconomics. The economics department polled students about what courses they would like added to the curriculum and the runaway winners were Marx and the stock market. Smith wasnu2019t interested in Marx, but the chair of his thesis committee was Tobin, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, in part for his analysis of financial markets. So, Smith volunteered to create a stock market course and asked Tobin to recommend a textbook. His immediate answer was John Burr Williamsu2019 The Theory of Investment Value, which had been published more than 30 years earlier, in 1938, and was not really a textbook. It was Williamsu2019 Ph.D. thesis and had been rejected by several publishers for being overly academic (it had algebraic symbols!). Harvard University Press published it, but Williams had to pay part of the printing cost himself. This stock-market course pulled Smith away from macroeconomics towards finance, and the use and misuse of statistics in finance pulled Smith towards a lifelong interest in the abuse of data and statistical analysis. Tobin once wryly observed that the bad old days when researchers had to do calculations by hand were actually a blessing. In today's language, it was a feature, not a flaw. The calculations were so hard that people thought hard before they calculated. Today, with terabytes of data and lightning-fast computers, it is too easy to calculate first, think later. Smith argues that it is better to think hard before calculating. Smith has been a lifelong proponent of value investing, buying stocks based on the cash they generate, instead of trying to predict short-term movements in stock prices. The same principles apply to real estate. From a financial standpoint, the decision to buy a house should be based on the cash flowu2014the rental savings minus the mortgage payments, property taxes, and other expenses associated with home ownershipu2014not guesses about future home prices. All real estate is local, so the answer to the question of whether a house is a good financial investment varies from place to place. A widely cited Brookings paper, co-authored with his wife Margaret H. Smith, applied this reasoning to ten U. S. metropolitan areas in 2005 and concluded that there was not a nationwide real estate bubble. In cities like Indianapolis and Dallas, residential real estate looked like a terrific long-run investment in that the rent savings were much larger than the expenses. A follow-up study by Smith found that, not only in these 10 metropolitan areas, but in cities throughout California, areas with relatively low price/rent ratios were the most resistant to the drop in home prices between 2005 and 2010. When intellectual ability, athletic prowess, and other traits are measured imperfectly, those who seem to be the most able are more likely to have been overrated than underrated. Their subsequent performance consequently tends to regress by being closer to the mean than previously. This little-understood phenomenon of regression reaches into nearly every aspect of life, from academic achievements to athletic performance to corporate profits to the campaign trail. It happens with students, athletes, CEOs, politicians, and soul mates. The baseball star having an MVP season one year is likely to do worse the next. The hot company will eventually cool down; popular presidents will in time see a plunge in the polls. And vice versa. Smith has investigated regression in education, sports, forecasting, business, and investing. The efficient-market hypothesis holds that stock prices take into account all relevant information, so that no investor can beat the market by taking advantage of othersu2019 ignorance. Evidence that contradicts the efficient market hypothesis has become known as anomalies. In addition to stock market anomalies created by an insufficient appreciation of regression to the mean, Smith has found that a portfolio of the stocks identified each year by Fortune magazine as America's most admired companies outperformed the market, contradicting the efficient market hypothesis. He also found that a portfolio of stocks with clever, eye-catching ticker symbolsu2014for example, LUV (Southwest Airlines), MOO (United Stockyards), and GEEK (Internet America)u2014beat the market, again contradicting the efficient market hypothesis. In another study, Smith found that the U. S. stock market has done better on sunny days than on cloudy days in New York City even though daily fluctuations in New York's cloudiness do not affect the fundamental value of the stocks being traded. Although not a stock market anomaly, another Smith paper found further evidence of the cognitive biases that lead investors astray: experienced poker players tend to be less cautious after large losses, evidently attempting to recoup their losses quickly.  If investors are like poker players, their behavior might well be affected by large gains and losses, for example, making otherwise imprudent long-shot investments with the hope of offsetting a prior loss cheaply. Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky's analysis of basketball data debunked the common perception that players sometimes have u201chot hands.u201d In fact, they found that the probability of making a shot was usually somewhat lower after having made shots than after having missed shots. However, data from basketball games have several confounding influences. A player's two successive shots might be taken 30 seconds apart, 5 minutes apart, in different halves of a game, or even in different games. Another problem is that a player who makes several shots may be more willing to take difficult shots than is a player who has been missing shots. In addition, the opposing team may guard a player differently when he is perceived to be hot or cold. Smith analyzed bowling and horseshoe pitchingu2014sports that do not have these confounding influencesu2014and found evidence of hot hands. Players were more likely to do well after having done well than after having done poorly. The observed fluctuations in performance are not nearly as large as many people think, but are large enough to be the difference between victory and defeat. In his early statistics textbooks, Smith cited a study claiming that famous people can postpone death until after the celebration of their birthdays. Several of Smith's students attempted to replicate this finding, and could not. Puzzled by this, Smith and another student (Heather Royer, now a professor herself) reexamined the birthday/deathday data and found that the author had lumped together all deaths that occurred during the birth month, not distinguishing those that occurred before the birthday from those that occurred afterward. Deaths that occurred during the birth month were counted as having been postponed until after the birthday celebration. There is no logical reason for this bizarre accounting other than it gave the results the authors wanted. Royer and Smith found that of the 26 famous people who died during their birth month, 13 died before their birthdays, 1 died on his birthday, and 12 died after their birthdays! The 26 people who died close to their birthdays were completely unsuccessful in postponing death. Royer and Smith also separated deaths into 30 days before the birthday, 30 days after, and so on, and found no evidence that people are able to postpone death. These discoveries led Smith to re-examine studies that allegedly showed people postponing death to celebrate Jewish celebrations and the Harvest Moon Festival. He found that these studies had also massaged the data to support the desired conclusion. Smith then turned to several other published studies that seemed implausible. Each illustrated Ronald Coase's dictum, u201cIf you torture the data long enough, it will confess.u201d Smith's debunked claims that Asian-Americans are prone to have fatal hearts attacks on the fourth day of the month (the Baskerville effect), Chinese-Americans are more vulnerable to those diseases that Chinese astrology and traditional Chinese medicine associate with their birth years, people whose names have positive initials (such as ACE or VIP) live longer than do people with negative initials (such as PIG or DIE), people whose first names begin with the letter D die relatively young, baseball players who are elected to the Hall of Fame have a shortened life expectancy, baseball players born in August are prone to commit suicide, and hurricanes are more deadly if they have female name. The scientific method is based on rigorous tests of falsifiable hypotheses. Data mining instead puts data before theory by searching for statistical patterns. Sometimes, theories are made up after a pattern is found (HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known); other times, it is assumed that theories are not needed.  Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, for example, often rely on data-mining algorithms to construct models with little or no human guidance. Smith argues that computers are not intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word, and should not be trusted to select models for making important decisions: u201cThe real danger today is not that computers are smarter than us, but that we think computers are smarter than us.u201d tA plethora of patterns are inevitable in large data sets and computer algorithms have no effective way of assessing whether data-mined patterns are truly useful or just meaningless coincidences. While data mining sometimes discovers useful relationships, Smith argues that the data deluge has caused the number of possible patterns that can be discovered relative to the number that are genuinely useful to grow exponentiallyu2014which makes it increasingly unlikely that discovered patterns are useful. This is the Paradox of Big Data: data mining is most seductive when there are a large number of variables to analyze, but the inevitable coincidental patterns in large data sets make it more likely that the statistical relationships discovered by data mining are spurious.

            "Christof Koch (/ku0252x/ KOKH; born November 13, 1956) is a German-American neurophysiologist and computational neuroscientist best known for his work on the neural basis of consciousness. He is the president and chief scientist of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. From 1986 until 2013, he was a professor at the California Institute of Technology. Koch was born in the Midwestern United States, and subsequently was raised in the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Morocco. Koch is the son of German parents; his father was a diplomat, as is his older brother Michael. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended a Jesuit high school in Morocco. His interest in consciousness commenced as a child when he decided that consciousness must apply to all animals, not just humans. He received a PhD in sciences for his works in the field of nonlinear information processing from the Max Planck Institute in Tu00fcbingen, Germany, in 1982. Koch worked for four years at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT before joining, in 1986, the newly started Computation and Neural Systems PhD program at the California Institute of Technology. Koch has authored more than 300 scientific papers and five books about how computers and neurons process information. In 1986, Koch and Shimon Ullman proposed the idea of a visual saliency map in the primate visual system. Subsequently, his then PhD-student, Laurent Itti, and Koch developed a popular suite of visual saliency algorithms. For over two decades, Koch and his students have carried out detailed biophysical simulations of the electrical properties of neuronal tissue, from simulating the details of the action potential propagation along axons and dendrites to the synthesis of the local field potential and the EEG from the electrical activity of large populations of excitable neurons. Since the early 1990s, Koch has argued that identifying the mechanistic basis of consciousness is a scientifically tractable problem, and has been influential in arguing that consciousness can be approached using the modern tools of neurobiology. He and his student Nao Tsuchiya invented continuous flash suppression, an efficient psychophysical masking technique for rendering images invisible for many seconds. They have used this technique to argue that selective attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena, with distinct biological functions and mechanisms. Koch's primary collaborator in the endeavor of locating the neural correlates of consciousness was the molecular biologist turned neuroscientist, Francis Crick, starting with their first paper in 1990 and their last one, that Crick edited on the day of his death, July 24, 2004, on the relationship between the claustrum, a mysterious anatomical structure situated underneath the insular cortex, and consciousness. Over the last decade, Koch has worked closely with the psychiatrist and neuroscientist Giulio Tononi. Koch advocates for a modern variant of panpsychism, the ancient philosophical belief that some form of consciousness can be found in all things. Tononi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness differs from classical panpsychism in that it only ascribes consciousness to things with some degree of irreducible cause-effect power, which could include the internet \"Thus, its sheer number of components exceeds that of any one human brain. Whether or not the Internet today feels like something to itself is completely speculative. Still, it is certainly conceivable.\" but does not include \"a bunch of disconnected neurons in a dish, a heap of sand, a galaxy of stars or a black hole,\" and by providing an analytical and empirically accessible framework for understanding experience and its mechanistic origins. He and Tononi claim that IIT is able to solve the problem in conceiving how one mind can be composed of an aggregate of \"smaller\" minds, known as the combination problem. Koch writes a popular column, Consciousness Redux, for Scientific American Mind on scientific and popular topics pertaining to consciousness. Koch co-founded the Methods in Computational Neuroscience summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole in 1988, the Neuromorphic Engineering summer school in Telluride, Colorado in 1994 and the Dynamic Brain summer course at the Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island in 2014.  All three summer schools continue to be taught. In early 2011, Koch became the chief scientist and the president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, leading their ten-year project concerning high-throughput large-scale cortical coding. The mission is to understand the computations that lead from photons to behavior by observing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the visual brain of behaving mice. The project seeks to catalogue all the building blocks (ca. 100 distinct cell types) of the then visual cortical regions and associated structures (thalamus, colliculus) and their dynamics. The scientists seek to know what the animal sees, how it thinks, and how it decides. They seek to map out the murine mind in a quantitative manner. The Allen Institute currently employs about 300 scientists, engineers, technologists and supporting personnel. The first eight years of this ten-year endeavor to build brain observatories were funded by a donation more than $500 million by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen. Koch is a proponent of the idea that consciousness is a fundamental property of complex nervous networks. In 2014, he published a short discussion work, In which I argue that consciousness is a fundamental property of complex things, where he introduced the concept that consciousness is a fundamental property of networked entities, and therefore cannot be derived from anything else, since it is a simple substance. In 2023, Koch lost a 25-year bet to philosopher David Chalmers. Koch bet that the neural underpinnings of consciousness will be well-understood by 2023, while Chalmers, bet the contrary. Upon losing the bet, Koch gifted Chalmers with a case of fine wine. Koch is a vegetarian, a bicyclist, and an experienced rock climber."

            "Stephan Lewandowsky (born 3 June 1958) is an Australian psychologist. He has worked in both the United States and Australia, and is currently based at the University of Bristol, UK, where he is the chair of cognitive psychology at the School of Psychological Science. His research, which originally pertained to computer simulations of people's decision-making processes, recently has focused on the public's understanding of science and why people often embrace beliefs that are sharply at odds with scientific evidence. Lewandowsky received his bachelor's degree from Washington College in 1980, followed by an M.A. in 1981 and a PhD in 1985, both from the University of Toronto. He served as an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1994, and as associate professor for one year after that. In 1995, he joined the University of Western Australia, where he became the Winthrop Professor of Psychology in 2000. He remained there until April 2013, when he joined the University of Bristol. In 2014, he was named the first Digital Content Editor at the Psychonomic Society. In 2015, Lewandowsky was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Lewandowsky has published a number of studies examining people's belief in misinformation. In 2005, he was the lead author of a study which investigated people's beliefs in assertions about the Iraq War that had been retracted officially, and which examined people's beliefs about these assertions in Australia, the United States, and Germany. He and his co-authors found that American participants in the study persisted in believing the assertions even after being informed that they had been retracted. Lewandowsky told the Wall Street Journal that the original misinformation already had become a part of the Americans' mental worldview by the time it was retracted. He also noted that \"People who were not suspicious of the motives behind the war continued to rely on misinformation.\" In 2012, Lewandowsky published an article in Psychological Science in the Public Interest which examined the literature on misinformation and efforts to correct it. He found a considerable amount of speculation but little concrete research into the area. With John Cook, Lewandowsky wrote \"The Debunking Handbook\", a review of research on debunking falsehoods and a guide to better practices for doing so. Much of \"The Debunking Handbook\" focuses on \"backfire effects\", whereby telling people that they are wrong often reinforces their prior beliefs, rather than weakening them. An updated Debunking Handbook 2020 tries to represent the consensus of the field. In 2012, Lewandowsky put forward what would later become one of his best-known studies regarding public opinion on climate change. The survey examined data from more than 1,000 readers of climate science blogs, taken from online questionnaires posted there. Lewandowsky approached five climate sceptic blogs to ask them to post the questionnaire, but they all declined to do so. The study was accepted by Psychological Science on 7 July 2012, and published in the May 2013 issue of the journal with the title, \"NASA Faked the Moon Landingu2014Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\". Based on a survey of visitors to global warming related blogs, Lewandowsky and his two co-authors concluded that belief in free-market economics was associated with being more likely to reject not only the mainstream scientific view of global warming, but also the mainstream scientific position on whether HIV causes AIDS and whether tobacco smoking causes lung cancer. The study also concluded that believing in a \"cluster of conspiracy theories\"u2014such as that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.u2014was also associated with being more likely to reject the consensus view on global warming. Gary Marcus wrote that the paper's findings \"fit in with a longer literature on what has come to be known as 'motivated reasoning.'\" The reaction to the paper from global warming sceptics was overwhelmingly negative, with Joanne Nova referring to it as \"an ad hom argument taken to its absurd extreme, rebadged as 'science'.\" Later in 2013, Lewandowsky published another paper on a similar topic in Nature Climate Change. In that study, he and his co-authors told the study participants that 97% of climate scientists believe humans are causing global warming, and found that this significantly increased the proportion of people who believed it as well. They also reported that the effect was most discernible for those with free-market views. These findings contributed to what is now known as the Gateway Belief Model. Also in 2013, Lewandowsky and co-authors conducted another survey in which he examined the relationship between believing in conspiracy theories (such as 9/11 conspiracy theories) and rejection of various forms of science. They found that believing in such conspiracy theories was strongly associated with being more likely to reject all forms of science, such as climate change science, the safety of genetically modified foods, and the safety of vaccines. On 28 March 2013, Lewandowsky published \"Recursive fury: Conspiracist ideation in the blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation\" in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. This paper described the reaction of climate change deniers to pre-publication versions of the \"NASA Faked the Moon Landingu2014Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\" study that he had submitted to Psychological Science in 2012. His analysis found that, of the hypotheses generated by climate change deniers in response to his 2012 study, \"many...exhibited conspiratorial content and counterfactual thinking.\" The Frontiers in Psychology journal received immediate complaints, and took the paper down while it carried out an investigation. The paper was retracted with a notice published in March 2014, which stated: In the light of a small number of complaints received following publication of the original research article cited above, Frontiers carried out a detailed investigation of the academic, ethical, and legal aspects of the work. This investigation did not identify any issues with the academic and ethical aspects of the study. It did, however, determine that the legal context is insufficiently clear and therefore Frontiers wishes to retract the published article. The authors understand this decision, while they stand by their article and regret the limitations on academic freedom which can be caused by legal factors.Ars Technica reported that its questions were referred by the publishers to their lawyer, who told Ars: \"Frontiers is concerned about solid science, and it's obviously a regret when you have to retract an article that is scientifically and ethically sound.\" Freedom of Information requests made by DeSmogBlog had obtained copies of the complaints, which included allegations of misconduct: some used legal terms such as \"defamatory\". Staff of the Australian Psychological Society wrote to Lewandowsky expressing concern \"that some scientific journals feel sufficiently threatened by potential liability fears to not publish articles with 'inconvenient information' about climate change.\" Elaine McKewonu2014who was one of the peer-reviewers of the Lewandowsky paper, in addition to being a research associate at the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, University of Technology, Sydneyu2014said that she was \"profoundly disappointed\" by its retraction, and that, \"Shortly after publication, Frontiers received complaints from climate deniers who claimed they had been libeled in the paper and threatened to sue the journal unless the paper was retracted.\" McKewon was quoted as saying that the journal had \"caved in at the first pushback from the climate change denial community\". The Sydney Morning Herald reported that academics had described the retraction as having \"a chilling effect on research\". The University of Western Australia published the paper online after doing its own risk analysis; their lawyer, Kim Heitman, said that there was no reason to take it down. After media reports about this retraction, the journal's Editorial Director Costanza Zucca and Executive Editor Fred Fenter made a joint statement on the journal's blog that \"Frontiers did not 'cave in to threats'; in fact, Frontiers received no threats.\" The statement said that the main reason for retraction was insufficient protection for the rights of the studied subjects. Ars Technica reported that this statement appeared to differ from the retraction notice, and according to one of the authors of the paper an anonymised version had been produced to meet the privacy concerns. Lewandowsky said that there had been a legally binding agreement on the original notice, and what he took \"exception to is their latest statement, which is incompatible with the signed agreement and complete news to us\". The paper is available at the web page of the University of Western Australia. The paper was later republished in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology along with additional data, under the title \"Recurrent fury: Conspiratorial Discourse in the Blogosphere Triggered by Research on the Role of Conspiracist Ideation in Climate Denial\". In May 2014, Lewandowsky published a two-part study on the relationship between uncertainty and the dangers of climate change, in which he argued that policymakers who argue that the scientific understanding of climate change is too uncertain to act are mistaken. Instead, the study argues that \"on the contrary, uncertainty implies that the problem is more likely to be worse than expected in the absence of that uncertainty.\" Lewandowsky told Salon that these studies showed that \"uncertainty also increases the likelihood of exceeding 'safe' temperature limits and the probability of failing to reach mitigation targets.\" A 2015 study by Lewandowsky, James Risbey, and Naomi Oreskes found that there is no substantive evidence of a global warming hiatus. In its March 2019 edition, Scientific American published an article about his work that posited that people drawn to conspiracy theories share some psychological characteristics that may be clustered. A secondary title to the article asserted: \"Baseless theories threaten our safety and democracy. It turns out that specific emotions make people prone to such thinking\"."

            "Gary Nance Smith (born 1945) is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Economics at Pomona College. His research on financial markets statistical reasoning, and artificial intelligence, often involves stock market anomalies, statistical fallacies, and the misuse of data have been widely cited. Smith earned his B. S. in mathematics from Harvey Mudd College and enrolled in Yale Universityu2019s graduate economics program. After taking classes from James Tobin and William Brainard, he decided to focus on macroeconomics. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1971 and was hired as an assistant professor. In a demonstration of the law of comparative advantage, Smith taught the first-year graduate course in macroeconomics while Tobin taught the first-year graduate course in microeconomics. The economics department polled students about what courses they would like added to the curriculum and the runaway winners were Marx and the stock market. Smith wasnu2019t interested in Marx, but the chair of his thesis committee was Tobin, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, in part for his analysis of financial markets. So, Smith volunteered to create a stock market course and asked Tobin to recommend a textbook. His immediate answer was John Burr Williamsu2019 The Theory of Investment Value, which had been published more than 30 years earlier, in 1938, and was not really a textbook. It was Williamsu2019 Ph.D. thesis and had been rejected by several publishers for being overly academic (it had algebraic symbols!). Harvard University Press published it, but Williams had to pay part of the printing cost himself. This stock-market course pulled Smith away from macroeconomics towards finance, and the use and misuse of statistics in finance pulled Smith towards a lifelong interest in the abuse of data and statistical analysis. Tobin once wryly observed that the bad old days when researchers had to do calculations by hand were actually a blessing. In today's language, it was a feature, not a flaw. The calculations were so hard that people thought hard before they calculated. Today, with terabytes of data and lightning-fast computers, it is too easy to calculate first, think later. Smith argues that it is better to think hard before calculating. Smith has been a lifelong proponent of value investing, buying stocks based on the cash they generate, instead of trying to predict short-term movements in stock prices. The same principles apply to real estate. From a financial standpoint, the decision to buy a house should be based on the cash flowu2014the rental savings minus the mortgage payments, property taxes, and other expenses associated with home ownershipu2014not guesses about future home prices. All real estate is local, so the answer to the question of whether a house is a good financial investment varies from place to place. A widely cited Brookings paper, co-authored with his wife Margaret H. Smith, applied this reasoning to ten U. S. metropolitan areas in 2005 and concluded that there was not a nationwide real estate bubble. In cities like Indianapolis and Dallas, residential real estate looked like a terrific long-run investment in that the rent savings were much larger than the expenses. A follow-up study by Smith found that, not only in these 10 metropolitan areas, but in cities throughout California, areas with relatively low price/rent ratios were the most resistant to the drop in home prices between 2005 and 2010. When intellectual ability, athletic prowess, and other traits are measured imperfectly, those who seem to be the most able are more likely to have been overrated than underrated. Their subsequent performance consequently tends to regress by being closer to the mean than previously. This little-understood phenomenon of regression reaches into nearly every aspect of life, from academic achievements to athletic performance to corporate profits to the campaign trail. It happens with students, athletes, CEOs, politicians, and soul mates. The baseball star having an MVP season one year is likely to do worse the next. The hot company will eventually cool down; popular presidents will in time see a plunge in the polls. And vice versa. Smith has investigated regression in education, sports, forecasting, business, and investing. The efficient-market hypothesis holds that stock prices take into account all relevant information, so that no investor can beat the market by taking advantage of othersu2019 ignorance. Evidence that contradicts the efficient market hypothesis has become known as anomalies. In addition to stock market anomalies created by an insufficient appreciation of regression to the mean, Smith has found that a portfolio of the stocks identified each year by Fortune magazine as America's most admired companies outperformed the market, contradicting the efficient market hypothesis. He also found that a portfolio of stocks with clever, eye-catching ticker symbolsu2014for example, LUV (Southwest Airlines), MOO (United Stockyards), and GEEK (Internet America)u2014beat the market, again contradicting the efficient market hypothesis. In another study, Smith found that the U. S. stock market has done better on sunny days than on cloudy days in New York City even though daily fluctuations in New York's cloudiness do not affect the fundamental value of the stocks being traded. Although not a stock market anomaly, another Smith paper found further evidence of the cognitive biases that lead investors astray: experienced poker players tend to be less cautious after large losses, evidently attempting to recoup their losses quickly.  If investors are like poker players, their behavior might well be affected by large gains and losses, for example, making otherwise imprudent long-shot investments with the hope of offsetting a prior loss cheaply. Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky's analysis of basketball data debunked the common perception that players sometimes have u201chot hands.u201d In fact, they found that the probability of making a shot was usually somewhat lower after having made shots than after having missed shots. However, data from basketball games have several confounding influences. A player's two successive shots might be taken 30 seconds apart, 5 minutes apart, in different halves of a game, or even in different games. Another problem is that a player who makes several shots may be more willing to take difficult shots than is a player who has been missing shots. In addition, the opposing team may guard a player differently when he is perceived to be hot or cold. Smith analyzed bowling and horseshoe pitchingu2014sports that do not have these confounding influencesu2014and found evidence of hot hands. Players were more likely to do well after having done well than after having done poorly. The observed fluctuations in performance are not nearly as large as many people think, but are large enough to be the difference between victory and defeat. In his early statistics textbooks, Smith cited a study claiming that famous people can postpone death until after the celebration of their birthdays. Several of Smith's students attempted to replicate this finding, and could not. Puzzled by this, Smith and another student (Heather Royer, now a professor herself) reexamined the birthday/deathday data and found that the author had lumped together all deaths that occurred during the birth month, not distinguishing those that occurred before the birthday from those that occurred afterward. Deaths that occurred during the birth month were counted as having been postponed until after the birthday celebration. There is no logical reason for this bizarre accounting other than it gave the results the authors wanted. Royer and Smith found that of the 26 famous people who died during their birth month, 13 died before their birthdays, 1 died on his birthday, and 12 died after their birthdays! The 26 people who died close to their birthdays were completely unsuccessful in postponing death. Royer and Smith also separated deaths into 30 days before the birthday, 30 days after, and so on, and found no evidence that people are able to postpone death. These discoveries led Smith to re-examine studies that allegedly showed people postponing death to celebrate Jewish celebrations and the Harvest Moon Festival. He found that these studies had also massaged the data to support the desired conclusion. Smith then turned to several other published studies that seemed implausible. Each illustrated Ronald Coase's dictum, u201cIf you torture the data long enough, it will confess.u201d Smith's debunked claims that Asian-Americans are prone to have fatal hearts attacks on the fourth day of the month (the Baskerville effect), Chinese-Americans are more vulnerable to those diseases that Chinese astrology and traditional Chinese medicine associate with their birth years, people whose names have positive initials (such as ACE or VIP) live longer than do people with negative initials (such as PIG or DIE), people whose first names begin with the letter D die relatively young, baseball players who are elected to the Hall of Fame have a shortened life expectancy, baseball players born in August are prone to commit suicide, and hurricanes are more deadly if they have female name. The scientific method is based on rigorous tests of falsifiable hypotheses. Data mining instead puts data before theory by searching for statistical patterns. Sometimes, theories are made up after a pattern is found (HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known); other times, it is assumed that theories are not needed.  Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, for example, often rely on data-mining algorithms to construct models with little or no human guidance. Smith argues that computers are not intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word, and should not be trusted to select models for making important decisions: u201cThe real danger today is not that computers are smarter than us, but that we think computers are smarter than us.u201d tA plethora of patterns are inevitable in large data sets and computer algorithms have no effective way of assessing whether data-mined patterns are truly useful or just meaningless coincidences. While data mining sometimes discovers useful relationships, Smith argues that the data deluge has caused the number of possible patterns that can be discovered relative to the number that are genuinely useful to grow exponentiallyu2014which makes it increasingly unlikely that discovered patterns are useful. This is the Paradox of Big Data: data mining is most seductive when there are a large number of variables to analyze, but the inevitable coincidental patterns in large data sets make it more likely that the statistical relationships discovered by data mining are spurious. Gary Smith is married to Margaret Hwang Smith and has six children, Joshua, Joanna, Chaska, Cory, Cameron, and Claire. Chaska received his bachelors and masters degrees in math and computer science from Cornell University. He now resides in southern california and hopes to open a Taco Bell."

            "David Silver FRS (born 1976) is a principal research scientist at Google DeepMind and a professor at University College London. He has led research on reinforcement learning with AlphaGo, AlphaZero and co-lead on AlphaStar. He studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1997 with the Addison-Wesley award, and having befriended Demis Hassabis whilst at Cambridge. Silver returned to academia in 2004 at the University of Alberta to study for a PhD on reinforcement learning, where he co-introduced the algorithms used in the first master-level 9u00d79 Go programs and graduated in 2009. His version of program MoGo (co-authored with Sylvain Gelly) was one of the strongest Go programs as of 2009. After graduating from university, Silver co-founded the video games company Elixir Studios, where he was CTO and lead programmer, receiving several awards for technology and innovation. Silver was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship in 2011, and subsequently became a lecturer at University College London. His lectures on Reinforcement Learning are available on YouTube. Silver consulted for Google DeepMind from its inception, joining full-time in 2013. His recent work has focused on combining reinforcement learning with deep learning, including a program that learns to play Atari games directly from pixels.  Silver led the AlphaGo project, culminating in the first program to defeat a top professional player in the full-size game of Go. AlphaGo subsequently received an honorary 9 Dan Professional Certification; and won the Cannes Lion award for innovation. He then led development of AlphaZero, which used the same AI to learn to play Go from scratch (learning only by playing itself and not from human games) before learning to play chess and shogi in the same way, to higher levels than any other computer program. Silver is among the most published members of staff at Google DeepMind, with over 170,000 citations and has an h-index of 86 according to Google scholar. Silver was awarded the 2019 ACM Prize in Computing for breakthrough advances in computer game-playing. In 2021, Silver was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) for his contributions to Deep Q-Networks and AlphaGo. He was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2022."

            "Kentaro Toyama is a computer scientist and international development researcher, who works on the relationship of technology and global development. He is the W. K. Kellogg Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information and author of  Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology. Toyama was founding assistant director of Microsoft Research India, a Bangalore-based computer science laboratory, where he established the Technology for Emerging Markets group which conducts interdisciplinary research in the field of \"information and communication technologies for development\" (ICT4D). Together with AnnaLee Saxenian and Raj Reddy, he co-founded the International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development, a global platform for rigorous, academic, interdisciplinary research in ICT4D. Toyama received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Yale University, and an A.B. in Physics from Harvard University. Toyama's research spans several disparate areas, including ICT4D, development studies, computer vision, human-computer interaction, geographic information systems, and multimedia. He is best known for his research in ICT4D, which includes technology projects such as MultiPoint, Text-Free User Interfaces, Warana Unwired, and Digital Green, as well as observational studies of rural telecenters, mobile phones in developing countries, and the limits of technology for international development. He is an outspoken critic of the \"technological utopianism\" that he sees in initiatives such as One Laptop Per Child, and argues that technology only magnifies existing human intent and capacity. A two-part essay making this point appears in a Boston Review forum. The argument is expanded upon and extended further in Geek Heresy. He is also a faculty affiliate of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy (STPP) program at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. Toyama's research in computer vision involves automated tracking of objects in video. In 2002, he taught calculus at Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana. Toyama was named to the 2022 class of ACM Fellows, \"for contributions to the innovation and critique of digital technology for socio-economic development and social justice\". A paper he co-authored with Andrew Blake was awarded the Marr Prize at the 2001 International Conference on Computer Vision. That work was a precursor to some of the technology in Microsoft's Kinect product."

            "Maneesh Agrawala (born 1972) is a professor of computer science at Stanford University. He returned to Stanford in 2015 as the director of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, after nearly a decade on the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. Maneesh Agrawala was born to computer-science professor Ashok Agrawala from the University of Maryland. He attended the Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, MD, where he was part of a team (including Howard Gobioff) that won a supercomputer in the 1988 SuperQuest competition.  He was a finalist in the 1990 Westinghouse Science Talent Search. He received a B.S. in mathematics in 1994 and a Ph.D. in computer science in 2002, both from Stanford University.  While attending Stanford, he worked as a software consultant at Vicinity Corporation and in the rendering software group at Pixar Animation Studios.  He received a film credit for Pixar's A Bug's Life.  After graduating, Agrawala worked at Microsoft Research for three years, before joining the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. Agrawala's work focuses on the design of visual interfaces that help a user process digital information, often using cognitive design concepts.  For instance, LineDrive, a program developed by Agrawala, creates route maps that resemble hand-drawn maps, adapting cognitive and map-making techniques to help a computer user process information on a route.  This work was the focus of his 2002 Ph.D. dissertation, \"Visualizing Route Maps\".  He has also adapted cognitive science into visual interfaces for complex 3D models.  Agrawala has also developed a system that creates step-by-step assembly instructions for complex machines, using the idea of exploded views to help the user understand the spatial relationships between elements.  His user-centric approach is viewed as having broad applicability in the fields of computer graphics and user interfaces. Agrawala is the recipient of multiple awards, including an Okawa Foundation Research Grant in 2006, a Sloan Fellowship and NSF CAREER Award in 2007, a SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award in 2008, and a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2009. He was named to the 2022 class of ACM Fellows, \"for contributions to visual communication through computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and information visualization\"."

He is the founder of the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval and served as the editor-in-chief of ACM Transactions on Information Systems from 1995 to 2002.  He was also a member of the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board from 2000 to 2003. Since 2015, he is the Dean of the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was Chair of the UMass Amherst Computer Science Department from 2001 to 2007. Bruce Croft formed the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) in 1991, since when he and his students have worked with more than 90 industry and government partners on research and technology projects and have produced more than 900 papers. Bruce Croft has made major contributions to most areas of information retrieval, including pioneering work in clustering, passage retrieval, sentence retrieval, and distributed search. One of the most important areas of work for Croft  relates to ranking functions and retrieval models, where he has led the development of one of the major approaches to modeling search: language modelling. In later years, Croft also led the way in the development of feature-based ranking functions. Croft and his research group have also developed a series of search engines: InQuery, the Lemur toolkit, Indri, and Galago. These search engines are open source and offer unique capabilities that are not replicated in other research retrieval platforms source u2013 consequently they are downloaded by hundreds of researchers world wide. As a consequence of his work, Croft is one of the most cited researchers in information retrieval. Croft earned a bachelor's degree with honors in 1973 and a master's degree in computer science in 1974 from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  He earned his Ph.D in computer science from the University of Cambridge in 1979 and joined the University of Massachusetts, Amherst faculty later that year. Croft has received several prestigious awards, including:  This biographical article relating to a computer specialist is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

            "Ruth S. Aylett (born 1951) is a British author, computer scientist, professor, poet, and political activist. She is a professor of computer science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, where she specialises in affective computing, social computing, software agents, and humanu2013robot interaction. Aylett's research involves affective computing, social computing, software agents, and humanu2013robot interaction. She is the leader of Socially Competent Robots (SoCoRo), a project of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council that studies whether robots can assist autistic people in learning to recognize facial expressions and other social cues. She has also studied the use of \"emotionally literate\" robots for tutoring schoolchildren, developed interactive role-playing software intended to combat bullying, and performed with a robot poet named Sarah the Poetic Robot as part of the Edinburgh Free Fringe. Aylett earned a degree in mathematical economics at the London School of Economics, and began her career in computing by working in technical support at International Computers Limited for three years, before moving to the University of Sheffield to work in computing and robotics. She became a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University for five years, and then moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1989, as part of the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute there. She moved again to the University of Salford in 1992, first as part of the IT Institute there and later in the Centre for Virtual Environments. There, she became Professor of Intelligent Virtual Environments in 2000. In 2004, she moved to her present position at Heriot-Watt University. Aylett's book Robots: Bringing Intelligent Machines to Life? (2002) is a historical exploration on robots, on the history of robotics, and on research problems confronting roboticists. Aimed at high-school age students, it consists of a sequence of two-page illustrated spreads on each of its topics. She is the coauthor, with Judy Robertson, Lisa Gjedde, Rose Luckin and Paul Brna, of the self-published book Inside Stories: A Narrative Journey (2008), on the use of story-telling in education and the use of technology to assist in storytelling. Aylett is also the coauthor of the poetry pamphlet Handfast: Poetry Duets with Beth McDonough (Mothers Milk, 2016). It has a challenge-response format, in which a poem by one of the authors inspires a poem by the other author exploring the same theme. Aylett was born in London. She is the mother of writer and activist Owen Jones. She met her husband, union organiser Robert Jones, through their membership in the Militant tendency, a Trotskyist group within the Labour Party. He developed prostate cancer, and died in 2018. As a political activist, Aylett has advocated for the Labour Party, for improved labour security for university staff, for permanent residency for European Union citizens already in the UK at the time of Brexit, for academic freedom for faculty and students in the face of the 'Counter-terrorism and security bill' legislation by signing a letter claiming the bill ran counter to universities mission to foster free speech as well as being 'unenforceable' and 'unlawful', as well as support for transgender rights. She has served as one of the leaders of the Labour Party in Edinburgh Southern."

            "Thomas Lengauer (born 12 November 1952) is a German computer scientist and computational biologist. Lengauer studied Mathematics at the Free University of Berlin, earning his Diploma in 1975 and a Dr. rer. nat. (equivalent to a PhD) in 1976. Lengauer later gained an MSc (1977) and a PhD (1979) in computer science, both from Stanford University. He received his habilitation degree in computer science at Saarland University in 1984. In the seventies and early eighties Lengauer performed research in Theoretical Computer Science at Stanford University, Bell Labs and Saarland University. In 1984 Lengauer became Professor of Computer Science at University of Paderborn. In the eighties and early nineties, Lengauer's research concentrated on discrete optimization methods for the design of integrated circuits and on packing problems in manufacturing.  From 1992 to 2001 he was Professor of Computer Science at the University of Bonn and Director of the Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing at German National Center for Information Technology. Since 2001, he has been a Director of the Department on Computational Biology and Applied Algorithmics at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. With his Stanford PhD advisor Robert Tarjan, he is known for the Lengaueru2013Tarjan algorithm in graph theory. Since the early 1990s his research has focused on computational biology, particularly the alignment of molecular sequences, and also the prediction of protein structure and function, and computational drug screening and design. On the latter topic he cofounded the company BioSolveIT GmbH in Sankt Augustin, Germany, together with Christian Lemmen, Matthias Rarey, and Ralf Zimmer from his team at GMD. Since 2000 he and his team have developed methods for analysis of viral resistance of HIV; in 2005 he entered the field of computational epigenetics. Lengauer retired from his position as Director at Max Planck Institute for Informatics in 2018. Since 2019 he has been part-time affiliated with the Institute of Virology at Cologne University. Lengauer has been the PhD advisor of over 50 students and coauthored over 350 publications. Lengauer was a cofounder of the Conference Series European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA, 1993) and European Symposium on Computational Biology (ECCB, 2002). He was a member of the steering committee of the International Conference on Research in Computational Biology (RECOMB) from its inception in 1997 until 2010. He is a founding member of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and in 2014 became Vice President of this Society. He was elected as a Fellow of the ISCB in 2015. From January 2018 to January 2021 Lengauer was President of the ISCB. In 2003, Lengauer was awarded the Konrad Zuse Medal, the highest award of the Gesellschaft fu00fcr Informatik (German Informatics Society), as well as the Karl-Heinz-Beckurts Award. In 2010 he was awarded the AIDS Research Award of the Heinz-Ansmann Foundation, together with Rolf Kaiser and Marc Oette. In 2014 he received the Hector Science Award. Lengauer has been a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina since 2003. In 2006 he became the Speaker of the Section on Information Sciences of this Academy, in 2013 the Speaker of its Class of Natural Sciences, and in 2015 a Member of the Presidium of the Academy. Lengauer has also been a member of acatech, the German Academy of Science and Engineering, since 2007 and of Academia Europaea since 2010. Lengauer's twin brother Christian Lengauer was a Professor in the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics at the University of Passau."

Fox received his B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 1975, and his PhD in Computer Science from the Carnegie Mellon University in 1983 with the thesis \"Constraint-directed search: a case-study of job-shop scheduling.\" Fox started his academic career at Carnegie Mellon University as Associate Professor of Computer Science and Robotics, where he also headed the Center for Integrated Manufacturing Systems of The Robotics Institute. In 1991 he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was appointed Professor of Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. He is also Senior Fellow in the Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto. He is elected Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and elected fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advance Research. Fox's current research interests concern smart cities, in particular \"ontologies for modelling cities and their performance, causal analysis of crowd sourced data (e.g., analysis of reports provided by citizens to the city), and process mapping and analysis of city services (e.g., social services).\" In the past he has been particularly interested the fields of \"enterprise engineering (i.e., information technology for business process engineering), constrained-directed reasoning, a unified theory of scheduling, enterprise modelling (i.e., TOVE) and coordination theory.\" The TOVE project, acronym of TOronto Virtual Enterprise project is a project to develop an ontological framework for enterprise integration (EI) based on and suited for enterprise modeling. In the beginning of the 1990s it was initiated by Mark S. Fox and others at the University of Toronto . Initially the project had defined four goals: The TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering. In the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Gru00fcninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating: Fox published some books and numerous articles on Artificial Intelligence, Scheduling, Ontologies, and Enterprise Modelling.

            "Bart Preneel (born 15 October 1963 in Leuven, Belgium[betterxa0sourcexa0needed]) is a Belgian cryptographer and cryptanalyst. He is a professor at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in the COSIC group. He was the president of the International Association for Cryptologic Research  in 2008-2013 and project manager of ECRYPT. In 1987, Preneel received a degree in Electrical Engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven. In 1993, Preneel received a PhD in Applied Sciences from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. His dissertation in computer science, entitled Analysis and Design of Cryptographic Hash Functions, was advised by Joos (Joseph) P. L. Vandewalle and Renu00e9 J. M. Govaerts. Along with Shoji Miyaguchi, he independently invented the Miyaguchiu2013Preneel scheme, a structure that converts a block cipher into a hash function, used eg. in the hash function Whirlpool. He is one of the authors of the RIPEMD-160 hash function. He was also a co-inventor of the stream cipher MUGI which would later become a Japanese standard, and of the stream cipher Trivium which was a well-received[weaselxa0words] entrant to the eSTREAM project. He has also contributed to the cryptanalysis of RC4, SOBER-t32, MacGuffin, Helix, Phelix, Py, TPypy, the HAVAL cryptographic hash function, and the SecurID hash function.

            "Georg Gottlob FRS is an Austrian-Italian computer scientist who works in the areas of database theory, logic, and artificial intelligence and is Professor of Informatics at the University of Calabria. He was Professor at the University of Oxford. Gottlob obtained his undergraduate and PhD degrees in computer science at Vienna University of Technology in 1981. Gottlob is currently a chaired professor at the University of Calabria in Italy where he joined in 2023 due to the \"Fantastic u00c9quipe and great potential\" that he belivies there is in this University. He was a professor of computing science at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science, where he helped establish the information systems research group. He is also a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford. Previously, he was a professor of computer science at Vienna University of Technology, where he still maintains an adjunct position. He was elected a member of the Royal Society in May 2010. He is a founding member of the Oxford-Man Institute. He has published more than 250 scientific articles in the areas of computational logic, database theory, and artificial intelligence, and one textbook on logic programming and databases. In the area of artificial intelligence, he is best known for his influential early work on the complexity of nonmonotonic logics and on (generalised) hypertree decompositions, a framework for obtaining tractable structural classes of constraint satisfaction problems, and a generalisation of the notion of tree decomposition from graph theory. This work has also had substantial impact in database theory, since it is known that the problem of evaluating conjunctive queries on relational databases is equivalent to the constraint satisfaction problem. His recent work on XML query languages (notably XPath) has helped create the complexity-theoretical foundations of this area.  Gottlob has received numerous awards and honours including election to the Royal Society in 2010.  His nomination for the Royal Society reads: Georg Gottlob has made fundamental contributions to both artificial intelligence and to database systems. His research has centred on the algorithmic and logical aspects of knowledge representation, database queries, and recently for web data processing. His work has resulted in the invention of several efficient algorithms for constraint satisfaction, web data extraction and database query processing, some of which are now in widespread use. He has developed a common core to the underlying principles of artificial intelligence and databases. In his work on clarifying the intrinsic complexity of problems in these areas, Gottlob has solved open problems in computational logic, non-monotonic reasoning and database theory.Gottlob has also been designated as an ECCAI fellow  in 2002, and received honorary doctorates from the University of Klagenfurt (2016) and the University of Vienna (2020)."

In June 2023, he became a member of the Executive Advisory Committee of AI-CLIMATE, an AI Institute led by the University of Minnesota announced in May 2023 and supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The AI-CLIMATE team apply artificial intelligence to develop methods of estimating the amount of carbon sequestered in a field or forestry plot. Mulla received a BS in Earth Science in 1979 from the University of California, Riverside, and an MS in Agronomy in 1981 from Purdue University. His PhD in Agronomy (1983) with an emphasis on soil physics was also from Purdue University. Mulla's PhD dissertation was entitled u201cThe molecular dynamics, specific surface area, crystal composition, and swelling of clay-water systems.u201d Mulla began his academic career in 1983 as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at Washington State University (WSU) and was promoted to Professor in 1993. He came to the University of Minnesota in March 1995 and since then has been Larson Chair for Soil and Water Resources in the Department of Soil, Water, and Climate at the University of Minnesota (CFANS). He was Director of the Precision Agriculture Center at the University of Minnesota from January 2004 to July 2023 and was appointed a Founding Fellow of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota in 2007. Mulla has more than 220 publications with a transdisciplinary range of coauthors. His research includes precision agriculture and precision conservation, watershed management and modeling, and agricultural water quality. He and his colleagues have applied geostatistics, remote sensing, and GIS terrain analysis to precision agriculture. Mullau2019s work in precision agriculture includes the concept and development of management zones. His work in modeling water quality includes the transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, pesticides and sediment to either surface or groundwater. This includes research on hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (the so-called Dead Zone) that results from the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer in agricultural areas far upstream from the Gulf, including Minnesota. In 1998, this work led to him being appointed to the White House Task Force on Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, which was established in 1997. He assesses the efficacy of Best Management Practices (BMPs). In 2007, he was part of a study for the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) to develop a long-range conservation plan for biofuel production and environmental protection in Minnesota, and from 2010 to 2014, he led a study for the Minnesota state legislature on agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus sources affecting surface water quality. In 2023, he developed an alternative approach at utility-scale ground-mounted solar facilities to account for impacts on stormwater runoff from precipitation, solar array spacing and orientation, disconnected impervious surfaces, soil depth and bulk density, and perennial vegetation between arrays. In 2011, he was appointed to a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committee on numerical nutrient criteria (water quality standards) for Florida, which issued a report the following year. In 2013, he was appointed to the NAS committee on Mississippi River water quality assessment and monitoring, which organized a workshop on Mississippi water quality management. The geographical scope of Mullau2019s work extends to the Palouse region of eastern Washington as well as more than twenty countries, including Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, India, and China. In Morocco, he collaborated on a Millennium Challenge Corporation project that resulted in planting 8 million olive trees to control erosion and sequester carbon on 75,000 ha (750 sq km) of rainfed land. Mulla has been recognized for his research and contributions to the field: He has also served as Associate and Technical Editor for the Soil Science Society of America Journal, and as Associate Editor for the journal Precision Agriculture"

            "IBM Distinguished Engineer (2000) Honorary Doctorate, University of Crete (2015) Elected Member, Academia Europaea (2016) Fellow, Center of Integrated Quantum Science and Technology (IQST) (2019)  Kurt Gu00f6del Visiting Professor for Quantum Computing, TU Wien (2020)  Frank Leymann (25 September 1957 in Bochum) is a German computer scientist and mathematician. He is professor of computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and director and founder of the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS). Leymann studied Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and received a Master of Science degree in Mathematics (i.e. Dipl.-Math.) in 1982 from University of Bochum, Germany. He worked as research staff member in the Faculty of Mathematics at University of Bochum, where he obtained his PhD in Mathematics (i.e. Dr. rer. nat.) in 1984. In his PhD thesis he studied foliations on spaces with singularities. After his PhD he went to IBM Research and Development contributing to software products like DB2, Websphere, or MQSeries. Leymann was main co-inventor and chief software architect of IBM's business process management and workflow products, and was appointed IBM Distinguished Engineer for this work. In 2004, he was appointed full professor of computer science at University of Stuttgart where he founded the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems. He holds many granted patents in the area of software. Frank Leymann's main contributions are from the domains of workflow systems, service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, pattern languages and quantum computing. His initial focus was on database technology:   In order to simplify queries on relational databases with many tables, Leymann co-developed a universal relation system on top of existing relational database systems. Contributions to architectural aspects of stored procedures and user defined functions followed. The latter resulted in investigating the use of object databases, especially ObjectStore, as the underpinning of other middleware. At this time, developers were quite unfamiliar with object databases, thus, Leymann helped to create tooling to ensure proper performance of corresponding applications. Workflow systems support companies in modeling, optimizing, and executing their business processes in computing environments. Several languages have been proposed for modeling business processes, out which two languages are widely supported in industry: one of which is the OASIS (organization) standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) that Leymann co-invented and which in turn is based on Web Services Flow Language (WSFL), a language that Leymann authored for IBM; the other language is Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), which Leymann co-author too. Such modeling languages support \"programming in the large \" and allow splitting high-level logic of control- and data flow within an overall application from its low-level logic implementing elementary business functions; this way, workflow-based applications can be created, that allow changing business processes without having to change the programs implementing individual steps of the process.  Often, collections of such steps represent long running transactions, i.e. performed steps must succeed or - in case of an error - must be collectively undone; to support this behavior in business processes Leymann introduced compensating transactions in workflow systems Based on his contributions to IBM's workflow products, Leymann co-authored the seminal book \"Production Workflow\" that explains how to build scalable and reliable workflow systems. The architecture and implementation of workflow systems anticipated many aspects of service-oriented programming like the use of service interfaces, service invoker, or service listener. Consequently, from 2000 on, Leymann helped to define several of the original web service standards like WS-Addressing, WS-Business Activity, BPEL4People, or the Web Services Resource Framework. Especially, aggregation of web services has been addressed by BPEL and WSFL. How the plethora of web service standards fit into an architecture for an enterprise service bus was described in a book on the web service platform co-authored by Leymann. The work on the web services resource framework had already shown that elements of a computing infrastructure like hardware, operating systems etc. can be perceived as services too - just like software functionality. Consequently, complete applications can be outsource to the cloud, which requires standards and technology to provision and manage applications in such environments: Frank Leymann was initial co-author of OASIS TOSCA a language that allows to specify the structure of applications, their artifacts, and dependencies, as well as the associated operational semantics to automatically provision such applications. Leymann's group at University of Stuttgart built an open source implementation of this standard called OpenTOSCA. Guidelines for building applications that fit properly into the cloud have been derived jointly with industry partners and was published as a vendor-neutral language of cloud computing patterns. Leymann and his group investigated the use of pattern languages not only in the area of cloud computing but in several other domains like the internet of things, green business processes, or quantum computing. The use of pattern languages to (semi-)automatically rewrite the architecture of software has been suggested. Patterns are abstractions of concrete working solutions, but in course of the abstraction process the knowledge about these workings solutions is lost - with the consequence that working solutions are created over and over again when a pattern is applied. To avoid this ineffectiveness, the reuse of concrete solutions has been investigated and worked out. In order to show that pattern languages and corresponding new concepts are applicable outside of computer science, they are regularly applied in the humanities, especially to the domain of films and musicology. Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable today. But programming quantum computers is very different from programming classical computers. In order to support practitioners building solutions based on quantum computers, Leymann and his group proposed a platform for sharing knowledge about building corresponding applications. Within the project PlanQK (which Leymann leads as scientific director) this platform is built. Other work focuses on a software engineering method for developing hybrid quantum applications, and corresponding development tools supporting the creation of applications even on noisy quantum computers."

Fellows received his BA in Mathematics from Sonoma State University, and at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) his M.A. in Mathematics in 1982 and in 1985 his Ph.D. in Computer Science with the dissertation Encoding Graphs in Graphs. Until January 2016, Fellows was professor at Charles Darwin University, Australia, and Director of the Parameterized Complexity Research Unit (PCRU). He has taught in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, as well as in the UK and Europe; and has given invited talks around the world. In 2018, Fellows was awarded membership in Academia Europaea. In 2016, he received Australia's highest civilian honour, the Order of Australia, Companion to the Queen. In 2014 Fellows became one of ten inaugural fellows of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Also in 2014, he was named an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand (the first computer scientist to receive this honor). In 2007, Fellows was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. His German host was Rolf Niedermeier and Mike spent part of 2007 and most of 2008 at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universitu00e4t in Jena, Germany, working with Niedermeier. Also in 2007, Mike became one of the first Fellows of the Institute of Advanced Study (Durham), UK and a Fellow of Grey College at the University of Durham. He was also awarded an Australian Research Council Professorial Fellowship for five years, beginning 2010. He is an Area Editor for the Journal of Computer and System Sciences since 2004, and Advising Editor for the special Section on Parameterized Complexity in the same journal. He is Associate Editor for ACM Transactions on Algorithms. In 2008 he was Guest Editor for a special double issue of The Computer Journal containing 15 surveys on parameterized complexity. He is also Guest Editor (with others) for a Special Issue on Parameterized Complexity in the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization to be published in 2010. He is a member of the Steering Committee for the conference series International Workshop on Parameterized and Exact Computation, proceedings published by Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Michael Fellows is co-author of Computer Science Unplugged! www.csunplugged.org book and materials, which bring computational thinking activities to youth and adults and have been translated into over 25 languages. He is known for his innovative science communication. He is an organizer of the Creative Mathematical Sciences Communication (CMSC) conference series. An avid interest in politics was inspired by his mother Betty, long a leader in the California League of Women Voters, and a love of literature and movies is shared with his son, Max. Fellows wrote a series of passion plays about mathematics which were presented at the Victoria Fringe Festival and at NCTM at Asilimar in 1999. In 1999, he married Frances Novak Rosamond, also a scientist, who shares his love of mathematics and adventure. Fellows is recognized as one of the founders of parameterized complexity, a complexity framework that uses structure in hard problems for the design and analysis of algorithms for their solution. Parameterized complexity has strong connections to algorithmic engineering, and is increasingly important in fields as diverse as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Bioinformatics. In 2018, he received the Norwegian Research Council Toppforsk Award for his project, Parameterized Complexity for Practical Computing. The funding scheme supports scientific quality at the forefront of international research; boldness in scientific thinking and innovation. Dagstuhl Seminar 12241 Data Reduction and Problem Kernels June 10 u2013 15, 2012 was the occasion to honour Michael R. Fellows on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday. He was presented with a Springer festschrift: The Multivariate Algorithmic Revolution and Beyond - Essays Dedicated Michael R. Fellows on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday.  Editors: Hans L.

The Academia Europaea is an independent learned society and European Union's Academy of Humanities and Sciences. On the initiative of Royal Society and other National Academies in Europe, the Academia was founded in 1988 as the functioning Europe-wide Academy that encompasses all fields of scholarly inquiry. 2) Order of Australia, Companion to the Queen (AC) 2016. This is Australia's highest civilian honour, similar to UK knighthood. To appreciate this requires a trip to Wikipedia: Of the approximately 400 over the 50 years of the Australian national honours system, over all walks of life (politicians, sports stars, movie stars...) there have been approximately 60 AC academics, of which there are approximately 30 scientists, and of those, 6 Nobel Laureates.  I am the first computer scientist to receive this honour. 3) Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand (HFRSNZ) 2014. He is the second person whose primary research area is algorithms to receive this honor. Honorary Fellows include Einstein, Bohr, Curie, Darwin, Fleming, Priestley, Richter, Rutherford, altogether 230 since 1870. 4) EATCS Fellow 2014. Mike has been conferred one of the inaugural first 10 EATCS Fellows for \"his role in founding the field of parameterized complexity theory, which has become a major subfield of research in theoretical computer science, and for being a leader in computer science education\". 5) EATCS-NERODE Prize 2014. This award at ALGO/ESA and is for a series of papers on how to establish lower bounds on kernelization. The two papers and prize winners are: On problems without polynomial kernels, Hans Bodlaender, Rodney Downey, Michael Fellows, Danny Hermelin. Journal of Computer and System Sciences 2009. Infeasibility of instance compression and succinct PCPs for NP, Lance Fortnow, Rahul Santhanam, same journal 2011. 6) ABZ International Medal of Honor for Fundamental Contributions to Computer Science Education. This award through ETH-Zurich is for Mike's outreach to kids and the community. Fellows wrote Computer Science Unplugged! (www.csunplugged.org with New Zealand colleagues Tim Bell (University of Canterbury, NZ) and Ian Witten (Otago University, NZ). activities are the basis of workshops sponsored by Google across the world. They are used in codeweek.au and in curriculum in UK. The book has been translated into 19 languages. It is a global grass-roots movement. Mike and Frances Rosamond give workshops to Aboriginal schools in Australia, India and around the world. Professor Fellow says, u201cThe activities are based on modern research in computer science and mathematics.  These materials can be used to make early education more exciting and engaging,u201d Woven through Computer Science Unplugged is the importance of story: that presenting math and computing topics through story-telling and drama can captivate children and adults alike, and provides a whole new level of engagement.  Mike's activities are about thinking outside the box, whether sharing the unknowns of computer science and mathematics with elementary school children or running a mathematics event in a park.u201d Mike has been an Australian Professorial Fellow at the University of Newcastle, Australia and at Charles Darwin University, Australia. He is Visiting Professor at Royal Holloway University of London. In 2006, he was an inaugural Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, and at that time a Best Fellow of Grey College. In 2007, Mike received an Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. He collaborates extensively around the world. Fellow's books Computer Science Unplugged! written with Tim Bell and Ian Witten, and This is MEGA-Mathematics!, with Nancy Casey convey sophisticated concepts such as intractability, sorting networks, and cryptography. They have won several science popularization awards, and been translated into languages including Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and German, with more translations underway. Unplugged! was part of the famous British Faraday Christmas Lectures in 2008, which was given by Professor Christopher M. Bishop of UK Microsoft Research. Fellows is also the author of several passion plays about mathematics, with mathematical proofs enacted on-stage, which were performed at the Fringe Theatre in British Columbia. He has published five books and over 150 scientific articles Books and dissertation:"
