Professor Sugden's research combines game theory (mainly experimental game theory and coordination games) with moral and political philosophy. He is associated with the classical-liberal tradition of Hume, Mill, and Hayek. In his most cited work, Sugden explored how conventions of property, mutual aid, and voluntary supply of public goods can evolve spontaneously out of the interactions of self-interested individuals and can become moral norms. Sugden investigated a number of violations of the von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility axioms, and developed regret theory as an alternative with Graham Loomes. In support of this work, he developed a number of experimental methods to test theories of decision under risk. His work also deals with economic methods, in which he argues that economic models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world, but rather descriptions of imaginary worlds whose validity can only be inferred by how reasonable their predictions are. In The Community of Advantage, Sugden develops a contractarian approach to welfare economics that is based on opportunity sets and not individual preferences.  The shift from preferences to opportunity is partly motivated by recent experimental work indicating that individuals lack well-defined preferences.  In 2019, The Community of Advantage was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler Award for outstanding contribution in the field of the philosophy of the social sciences."

He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993. Professor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the information age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age ""is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected."" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.

What is the number of publications for the affiliation of the author who published 'Putting 'Engineering' into Software Engineering (Abstract)'?,<https://dblp.org/pid/93/5634>,b03eed39-2b32-4eae-9d83-5bb4b710179a,['Mary Shaw'],29,47,3393,166,0.0,https://semopenalex.org/institution/I74973139,Carnegie Mellon University,US,CMU,education,4774016,117175,"Mary Shaw (born 1943) is an American software engineer, and the Alan J. Perlis Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, known for her work in the field of software architecture. Mary M. Shaw was born in Washington D.C. in 1943. Her father (Eldon Shaw) was a civil engineer and economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and her mother (Mary Shaw) was a homemaker. Shaw attended high school in Bethesda, Maryland, during the Sputnik cold war era during which technology was rapidly improving[citation needed]. In high school, Shaw participated for two summers during high school in an after school program which taught students about computers. This program run by International Business Machines (IBM) and was a chance for student to explore fields outside of the normal curriculum. This was Shaw's first introduction to computers. Shaw obtained her BA from Rice University around 1965, and her PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1972. With Marion Cru00e9hange (1937 u2013 2022), a French computer scientist who got a PhD in Computer Science in 1961, she is considered a pioneer in computer science. After her graduation at Rice University, Shaw had started her career in industry, working as systems programmer at the Research Analysis Corporation. She also continued to do research at Rice University. In 1972 she joined the Carnegie Mellon University faculty, where she was eventually appointed Professor of Computer Science. From 1984 to 1987 she was also Chief Scientist at its Software Engineering Institute, from 1992 to 1999 Associate Dean for Professional Education, and from 2001 to 2006 Co-Director of the Sloan Software Industry Center. In 2011, Mary Shaw and David Garlan received the Outstanding Research Award from ACM SIGSOFT, the Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Software Engineering, for their ""significant and lasting software engineering research contributions through the development and promotion of software architecture."" On October 3, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Shaw with National Medal of Technology and Innovation. She was named recipient of the award in 2012. Shaw's main area of research interest is software engineering, including architectural, educational and historical aspects. Shaw authored seminal works in the field of software architecture along with David Garlan. Shaw's most cited work ""Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline,"" co-authored with David Garlan, examines the concept of ""architectures for software systems as well as better ways to support software development."" The book aims: ""... to bring together the useful abstractions of systems design and the notations and tools of the software developer, and look at patterns used for system organization... to illustrate the discipling and examine the ways in which architectural design can impact software design. Our selection emphasizes informal descriptions, touching lightly on formal notations and specifications and on tools to support them.""In this work Garlan and Shaw ""describe an architecture of a system as a collection of computational components together with a description of the interactions between these componentsu2014the connectors."" A component is simply described as ""the elements that perform computation."" In 2011 Shaw and Garlan were awarded the Outstanding Research Award for 2011 by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in honor of their pioneering research in the field of Software Architecture. William Scherlis, the director of CMU's Institute for Software Research, commented on Shaw and Garlan contribution: The term 'software architecture' was first used in the late 1960s, but its significance didn't become clear until almost 20 years later, when David and Mary asserted that architecture could be addressed using systematic approaches. Their work and that of their colleagues here at Carnegie Mellon has since led to engineering methods for architectural modeling, analysis and identification of architecture-level patterns, the use of which has now become standard in the engineering of larger scale software systems.Articles, a selection:"

He is the recipient of an ERC Grant of 1.5Mu20ac with the P2P Models project, to research blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations for the collaborative economy. Samer Hassan is a scholar with an interdisciplinary background, which combines computer sciences with social sciences and activism. He received a degree in Computer Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in Spain. He also studied 3 years of Political Science at the distance learning university UNED. He has then undertaken a PhD in Social Simulation at the department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of UCM, supervised by the computer scientist Juan Pavu00f3n and the sociologist Millu00e1n Arroyo-Menu00e9ndez. He has been researching in several institutions, funded by several scholarships and awards, most notably Harvard's Real Colegio Complutense, and the Spanish postdoctoral grants Juan de la Cierva and Josu00e9 Castillejo. Thus, he was a visiting researcher at the Centre for Research in Social Simulation, in the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey in the UK, working under the supervision of Nigel Gilbert (2007-2008), and a lecturer at the American University of Science and Technology in Lebanon (2010u201311). He was selected as Fellow at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (2015-2017) and is presently a Faculty Associate at the same structure. As an activist, Samer Hassan has been engaged in both offline (La Tabacalera de Lavapiu00e9s, Medialab-Prado) and online (Ourproject.org, Barrapunto, Wikipedia) initiatives. He was accredited as a grassroots facilitator by the Altekio Cooperative. He co-founded the Comunes Nonprofit in 2009 and the Move Commons webtool project in 2010. He has co-organized practitioner-oriented workshops on platform co-ops and free/open source decentralized tools for communities, and has presented his work in non-academic conferences of Mozilla, the Internet Archive, and others. As a privacy advocate, he co-created a course on cyber-ethics which has been teaching since 2013 (as of 2021). He was co-founder of the Sci-Fdi Spanish science-fiction magazine. Samer Hassan's PhD thesis focused on the methodological challenges for building data-driven social simulation models. The main model built simulated the transition from modern values to postmodern values in Spain. His methodological work also explored the combination of different Artificial Intelligence technologies, i.e. software agents with fuzzy logic, data mining, natural language processing, and microsimulation. Hassan's interdisciplinary research spans multiple fields, including online collaborative communities, decentralized technologies, blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations, free/libre/open source software, Commons-based peer production, agent-based social simulation, social movements and cyberethics. He has published more than 50 works in these fields, and is recently focused on experimenting with multiple software systems to facilitate commons-based peer production, e.g. semantic-web labelling for commons-based initiatives, distribution of value in peer production communities, agent-supported online assemblies, decentralized real-time collaborative software, decentralized blockchain based reputation, or blockchain-enabled commons governance. Hassan was Principal Investigator of the UCM partner in the EU-funded P2Pvalue project on building decentralized web-tools for collaborative communities. As such, he led the team that created SwellRT, a federated backend-as-a-service focused to ease development of apps featuring real-time collaboration. Intellectual Property of this project was transferred to the Apache Software Foundation in 2017. As part of this research line, Hassan's team also develop two SwellRT-based apps, ""Teem"" for management of social collectives and Jetpad, a federated real time editor. He presented the innovations concerning these software at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center and Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society. Other research lines offered outcomes beyond publications. ""Wikichron"", coled by Javier Arroyo, is a web tool to visualize MediaWiki community metrics, currently in production and available for third-parties. ""Decentralized Science"", led by Hassan's PhD student u00c1mbar Tenorio-Fornu00e9s, is a framework to facilitate decentralized infrastructure and open peer review in the scientific publication process, which has been selected by the European Commission to receive funding as a spin-off social enterprise. His research on blockchain and crowdfunding models awarded him with a commission from Triple Canopy. His team pushed forward a mapping of the ecosystem of blockchain for social good, led by the Joint Research Centre and published by the European Commission. As part of his ERC project P2P Models, Samer Hassan and his team are investigating whether blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations could contribute to improving the governance of commons-oriented communities, both online and offline. Their work has been showcased for tackling the impact of blockchain on governance, proposing alternatives to the current sharing economy, emerging forms of techno-social systems like NFTs, or giving relevance to gender issues in the field. Hassan was invited to present the project achievements in Harvard Kennedy School, MIT Media Lab, Harvard's Data Privacy Lab, Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Harvard's SEAS EconCS.

Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

Dietterich is emeritus professor of computer science at Oregon State University. He is one of the pioneers of the field of machine learning. He served as executive editor of Machine Learning (journal) (1992u201398) and helped co-found the Journal of Machine Learning Research. In response to the media's attention on the dangers of artificial intelligence, Dietterich has been quoted for an academic perspective to a broad range of media outlets including National Public Radio, Business Insider, Microsoft Research, CNET, and The Wall Street Journal. Among his research contributions were the invention of error-correcting output coding to multi-class classification, the formalization of the multiple-instance problem, the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning, and the development of methods for integrating non-parametric regression trees into probabilistic graphical models. Thomas Dietterich was born in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1954. His family later moved to New Jersey and then again to Illinois, where Tom graduated from Naperville Central High School. Dietterich then entered Oberlin College and began his undergraduate studies. In 1977, Dietterich graduated from Oberlin with a degree in mathematics, focusing on probability and statistics. Dietterich spent the following two years at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After those two years, he began his doctoral studies in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Dietterich received his Ph.D. in 1984 and moved to Corvallis, Oregon, where he was hired as an assistant professor in computer science. in 2013, he was named ""Distinguished Professor"". In 2016, Dietterich retired from his position at Oregon State University. Throughout his career, Dietterich has worked to promote scientific publication and conference presentations. For many years, he was the editor of the MIT Press series on Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning. He also held the position of co-editor of the Morgan Claypool Synthesis Series on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He has organized several conferences and workshops including serving as Technical Program Co-Chair of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-90), Technical Program Chair of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS-2000) and General Chair of NIPS-2001. He served as founding President of the International Machine Learning Society and he has been a member of the IMLS Board since its founding. He is currently also a member of the Steering Committee of the Asian Conference on Machine Learning. Professor Dietterich is interested in all aspects of machine learning. There are three major strands of his research. First, he is interested in the fundamental questions of artificial intelligence and how machine learning can provide the basis for building integrated intelligent systems. Second, he is interested in ways that people and computers can collaborate to solve challenging problems. And third, he is interested in applying machine learning to problems in the ecological sciences and ecosystem management as part of the emerging field of computational sustainability. Over his career, he has worked on a wide variety of problems ranging from drug design to user interfaces to computer security. His current focus is on ways that computer science methods can help advance ecological science and improve our management of the Earth's ecosystems. This passion has led to several projects including research in wildfire management, invasive vegetation and understanding the distribution and migration of birds. For example, Dietterich's research is helping scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology answer questions like: How do birds decide to migrate north? How do they know when to land and stopover for a few days? How do they choose where to make a nest? Tens of thousands of volunteer birdwatchers (citizen scientists) all over the world contribute data to the study by submitting their bird sightings to the eBird website. The amount of data is overwhelming u2013 in March 2012 they had over 3.1 million bird observations. Machine learning can uncover patterns in data to model the migration of species. But there are many other applications for the same techniques which will allow organizations to better manage our forests, oceans, and endangered species, as well as improve traffic flow, water systems, the electrical power grid, and more. I realized I wanted to have an impact on something that really mattered u2013 and certainly the whole Earth's ecosystem, of which we are a part, is under threat in so many ways. And so if there's some way that I can use my technical skills to improve both the science base and the tools needed for policy and management decisions, then I would like to do that. I am passionate about that.Dietterich has argued that the most realistic risks about the dangers of artificial intelligence are basic mistakes, breakdowns and cyberattacks, and the fact that it simply may not always work, rather than machines that become super powerful or destroy the human race. Dietterich considers machines becoming self-aware and trying to exterminate humans to be more science fiction than scientific fact. But to the extent that computer systems are given increasingly dangerous tasks, and asked to learn from and interpret their experiences, he said they may simply make mistakes. Instead, much of the work done in the AI safety community does indeed focus around accidents and design flaws. Thomas Dietterich was honored by Oregon State University in the spring of 2013 as a ""Distinguished Professor"" for his work as a pioneer in the field of machine learning and being one of the mostly highly cited scientists in his field. He has also earned exclusive ""Fellow"" status in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association for Computing Machinery. Over his career, he obtained more than $30 million in research grants, helped build a world-class research group at Oregon State, and created three software companies. He also co-founded two of the field's leading journals and was elected first president of the International Machine Learning Society. His other awards and honors include:"

His major contribution to science are in the areas of cell motility and division and innovations in cell imaging. Mogilner was born in the Soviet Union on May 22, 1962.  He received his doctorate in physics in 1990 at the Ural Division of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in his hometown of Ekaterinburg. After two years of research at the University of Manitoba, he returned to graduate school at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and received his Ph.D in applied mathematics, a program that combined math and biology. His current work is in computational biology, which combines chemistry, biology, math and physics.[citation needed] One of Mogilner's research topics is the mitotic spindle and how it is assembled. The mitotic spindle is what pulls conjoined chromosomes apart during cell division. Mogilner hypothesized that the chromosomes were surrounded by proteins that directed the microtubules toward them. A few years after, research in Germany confirmed his prediction. His key papers on the subject have been cited hundreds of times; the most cited one, in Biophysical Journal has been cited 614 times by October 2014.

Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010.

In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

There, he holds the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Chair in Information and Computer Science.  Savage is widely cited in computer security, particularly in the areas of email spam, network worms and malware propagation, distributed denial of service (DDOS) mitigation and traceback, automotive hacking and wireless security. He received his undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington (2002). In 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published ""Sting"", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement. In 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems. In 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks. Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer. In 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network. In 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were ""propagating"", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005. In 2005, Ishwar Ramani and Stefan Savage developed Syncscan algorithm that cuts the time needed to switch between Wi-Fi access points. In 2004, Savage was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship, in 2010 he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and in 2013, he received the ACM SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award. In 2015, he received the ACM Prize in Computing for ""innovative research in network security, privacy, and reliability that has taught us to view attacks and attackers as elements of an integrated technological, societal, and economic system."" In 2017, he was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow (the ""genius grant"") for his body of work. Savage was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021  and was named a recipient of the American Association for the Advancement of Science-administered Golden Goose Award the same year. In 2022, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering."

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics. Stanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962. He performed biological physics research with Max Delbru00fcck in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967. Stanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph  Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971. Stanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden. Stanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nu00e0 infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks. His seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed with Texeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume [H. E. Stanley and J. Teixeira, u201cInterpretation of The Unusual Behavior of H2O and D2O at Low Temperatures: Tests of a Percolation Modelu201d J. Chem. Phys. 73, 3404u20133422 (1980)]. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of wateru2019s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford. Stanley coined the term u2018econophysicsu2019 in 1994 to denote the field of physics dealing with economic phenomena. His group has found empirical laws governing economic fluctuations, and proposed statistical mechanics models to explain their origins.   The ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201. Stanley is committed to education at all levels, from high school to graduate studies.  He has served as thesis advisor to 114 Ph.D. students and has collaborated with 211 postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. He is also active in worldwide efforts for achieving gender balance in the physical sciences. Stanley has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2004), the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.  He is an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Physical Society. He is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), and at Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest, Hungary).  Stanley awarded the 2004 APS Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, ""For his extraordinary contributions to human rights, for his initiatives on behalf of female physicists, and for his caring and supportive relationship with those who have worked in his laboratory."" For his contributions to phase transitions Stanley received the 2004 Boltzmann Medal, awarded by International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the American Physical Society 2008 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize.

Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of ""information, documentation, knowledge, and communication"" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as ""Madame Documentation,"" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric. Ronald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993. Professor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the information age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age ""is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected."" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a ""mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking"" that lent itself to being described by ""modernist tropes."" Day's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation. Day has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt ""to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on ""information"".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.""  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed ""documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization."" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006. Day's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence. In 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data through MIT Press where he ""examines information 'as a cultural and social phenomenonu201d during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.'"" Again, he relies on his knowledge of Briet to explore indexing and ""the transition of indexes from explicit professional structures that mediate the relation of user needs and documentary information seeking, searching, and retrieving to being implicit infrastructural devices in everyday information and communication acts."" It was winner of the Best Information Science Book Award from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2015. In this respect, this book is not unlike an earlier work by Geoffrey C.

He is Associate Professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) and Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He is the recipient of an ERC Grant of 1.5Mu20ac with the P2P Models project, to research blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations for the collaborative economy. Samer Hassan is a scholar with an interdisciplinary background, which combines computer sciences with social sciences and activism. He received a degree in Computer Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in Spain. He also studied 3 years of Political Science at the distance learning university UNED. He has then undertaken a PhD in Social Simulation at the department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of UCM, supervised by the computer scientist Juan Pavu00f3n and the sociologist Millu00e1n Arroyo-Menu00e9ndez. He has been researching in several institutions, funded by several scholarships and awards, most notably Harvard's Real Colegio Complutense, and the Spanish postdoctoral grants Juan de la Cierva and Josu00e9 Castillejo. Thus, he was a visiting researcher at the Centre for Research in Social Simulation, in the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey in the UK, working under the supervision of Nigel Gilbert (2007-2008), and a lecturer at the American University of Science and Technology in Lebanon (2010u201311). He was selected as Fellow at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (2015-2017) and is presently a Faculty Associate at the same structure. As an activist, Samer Hassan has been engaged in both offline (La Tabacalera de Lavapiu00e9s, Medialab-Prado) and online (Ourproject.org, Barrapunto, Wikipedia) initiatives. He was accredited as a grassroots facilitator by the Altekio Cooperative. He co-founded the Comunes Nonprofit in 2009 and the Move Commons webtool project in 2010. He has co-organized practitioner-oriented workshops on platform co-ops and free/open source decentralized tools for communities, and has presented his work in non-academic conferences of Mozilla, the Internet Archive, and others. As a privacy advocate, he co-created a course on cyber-ethics which has been teaching since 2013 (as of 2021). He was co-founder of the Sci-Fdi Spanish science-fiction magazine. Samer Hassan's PhD thesis focused on the methodological challenges for building data-driven social simulation models. The main model built simulated the transition from modern values to postmodern values in Spain. His methodological work also explored the combination of different Artificial Intelligence technologies, i.e. software agents with fuzzy logic, data mining, natural language processing, and microsimulation. Hassan's interdisciplinary research spans multiple fields, including online collaborative communities, decentralized technologies, blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations, free/libre/open source software, Commons-based peer production, agent-based social simulation, social movements and cyberethics. He has published more than 50 works in these fields, and is recently focused on experimenting with multiple software systems to facilitate commons-based peer production, e.g. semantic-web labelling for commons-based initiatives, distribution of value in peer production communities, agent-supported online assemblies, decentralized real-time collaborative software, decentralized blockchain based reputation, or blockchain-enabled commons governance. Hassan was Principal Investigator of the UCM partner in the EU-funded P2Pvalue project on building decentralized web-tools for collaborative communities. As such, he led the team that created SwellRT, a federated backend-as-a-service focused to ease development of apps featuring real-time collaboration. Intellectual Property of this project was transferred to the Apache Software Foundation in 2017. As part of this research line, Hassan's team also develop two SwellRT-based apps, ""Teem"" for management of social collectives and Jetpad, a federated real time editor. He presented the innovations concerning these software at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center and Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society. Other research lines offered outcomes beyond publications. ""Wikichron"", coled by Javier Arroyo, is a web tool to visualize MediaWiki community metrics, currently in production and available for third-parties. ""Decentralized Science"", led by Hassan's PhD student u00c1mbar Tenorio-Fornu00e9s, is a framework to facilitate decentralized infrastructure and open peer review in the scientific publication process, which has been selected by the European Commission to receive funding as a spin-off social enterprise. His research on blockchain and crowdfunding models awarded him with a commission from Triple Canopy. His team pushed forward a mapping of the ecosystem of blockchain for social good, led by the Joint Research Centre and published by the European Commission. As part of his ERC project P2P Models, Samer Hassan and his team are investigating whether blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations could contribute to improving the governance of commons-oriented communities, both online and offline. Their work has been showcased for tackling the impact of blockchain on governance, proposing alternatives to the current sharing economy, emerging forms of techno-social systems like NFTs, or giving relevance to gender issues in the field. Hassan was invited to present the project achievements in Harvard Kennedy School, MIT Media Lab, Harvard's Data Privacy Lab, Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Harvard's SEAS EconCS. British MP and Opposition Leader Ed Miliband showcased his research and its potential impact on policy."

Professor Sugden's research combines game theory (mainly experimental game theory and coordination games) with moral and political philosophy. He is associated with the classical-liberal tradition of Hume, Mill, and Hayek. In his most cited work, Sugden explored how conventions of property, mutual aid, and voluntary supply of public goods can evolve spontaneously out of the interactions of self-interested individuals and can become moral norms. Sugden investigated a number of violations of the von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility axioms, and developed regret theory as an alternative with Graham Loomes. In support of this work, he developed a number of experimental methods to test theories of decision under risk. His work also deals with economic methods, in which he argues that economic models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world, but rather descriptions of imaginary worlds whose validity can only be inferred by how reasonable their predictions are. In The Community of Advantage, Sugden develops a contractarian approach to welfare economics that is based on opportunity sets and not individual preferences.  The shift from preferences to opportunity is partly motivated by recent experimental work indicating that individuals lack well-defined preferences.  In 2019, The Community of Advantage was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler Award for outstanding contribution in the field of the philosophy of the social sciences."

Kastner (born November 20, 1945) is an American physicist and Donner Professor of Science and the former dean of the School of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently he is president of the Science Philanthropy Alliance. Kastner was born in Toronto, Ontario, on November 20, 1945. He completed his B.S. in chemistry in 1967, M.S. in 1969 and Ph.D. in physics in 1972 from the University of Chicago. Kastner was a Harvard Research Fellow from 1972 to 1973. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. He became Donner Professor of Science at MIT in 1989. He was appointed department head in February 1998. He served as the dean of the School of Science at MIT from 2007 to 2013. Kastner was a researcher on amorphous semiconductors. His early research focused on the relationship between chemical bonding and the electronic structure of defects in glasses. In 1990, his group at MIT discovered the single-electron transistor. It is a device in which electrostatic fields confine electrons to a small region of space inside a semiconductor. Single-electron transistors turn on and off again every time one electron is added. In an interview, he said that the discovery that a transistor could turn on and off again every time an electron was added to it was one of the most astounding and exciting experiences of his life. His recent research focused on the electronic properties of nanometer-size semiconductor structures and on the physics of high temperature (Tc ) superconductivity. Kastner received the 1995 David Adler Lectureship Award in the Field of Materials Physics from the American Physical Society for his research on semiconductors."

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory. Lasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society ""for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies."" Her specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization. Irena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study. After receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of. Optimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions. The work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations. Control Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, "" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance."" In simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal, and feedback is the mapping from outputs to inputs. This can be applied to many facets of real-life, especially in various engineering fields that concentrate on the control of changes in their field. A good example of control theory applied to the real world is something as simple as a thermostat. The output in this system is temperature, and the control is turning the dial on or off, or to a higher or lower temperature. Lasiecka uses this theory to further understand partial differential equations. She attempts to answer the questions of how to take advantage of a model in order to improve the system's performance. This idea is paired her desire to understand mathematical solutions of the problems of well-posedness and regularity, stabilization and stability, and optimal control for finite or infinite horizon problems and existence and uniqueness of associated Riccati equations. In Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, Lasiecka studies this concept through waves and hyperbolic models. This book was written in order to ""help engineers and professionals involved in materials science and aerospace engineering to solve fundamental theoretical control problems. Applied mathematicians and theoretical engineers with an interest in the mathematical quantitative analysis will find this text useful.""  Irena has written and edited numerous research journals and articles in addition to the above books."

His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled u201cMultiprocessor Systems with Process Communicationu201d where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur. His paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes. Based on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in. He published many other papers on queuing network models. These contributions lead him to obtain the IEEE Fellow rank in 1996, and in particular  to performance analysis of computer communication networks. In 1997 Ian Akyildiz with his colleagues at the YURIE  systems designed and implemented the first adaptive forward-error-correction solution on the link layer of their wireless ATM switch providing high reliability in wireless ATM networks with very low bit data rates used in battlefield scenarios. A patent for this solution was obtained in 2006 U.S. patent 7,058,027. A technical paper describing the link layer design on this low bit rate wireless ATM switch was published. The founder of the Yurie Systems, Jeong H. Kim, received the entrepreneur of the year award in 1997 and Yurie Systems was acquired by Lucent for 1 Billion US Dollars in 1998. Ian Akyildiz significantly contributed to mobility and resource management of 2G and 3G cellular systems in the 90s. He proposed many handoff management, location registration, and paging schemes for the design of 3G and 4G wireless systems, and all of his papers have been published in top notch journals and conferences between 1998 and 2000. His paper titled u201cMobility Management in Next-Generation Wireless Systemsu201d was invited to be included in Proceedings of IEEE, and is the most cited paper on mobility management in the literature, and became u201ctheu201d main reading material for the first course on mobile networks in many universities. His contributions to mobility and resource management gained him the ACM Fellow rank in 1997. Ian Akyildiz started to use the notion u201c4Gu201d wireless networks in 1999-2000 through his papers and keynote speeches. He clearly pointed out the requirements for heterogeneous 4G wireless systems, such as anywhere/anytime wireless connectivity with hundreds of Mbps bandwidth per mobile user for both data and multimedia services. Consequently, the first adaptive protocol suite framework for Next Generation Wireless Internet was supported by NSF (National Science Foundation) (2000-2005) NSF #:ANI-0117840. His early insights on the need to enable a single mobile terminal to seamlessly communicate over heterogeneous wireless access systems such as wireless LANs, 3G cellular networks, and satellite networks are seminal contributions to 4G systems.These ideas were the forerunner of the dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio networks. The culmination of his research work on this topic gained him the 2003 ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award for his ""pioneering contributions in the area of mobility and resource management for wireless communication networks"", in September 2003. Akyildiz, in collaboration and with support of NASA, developed several routing algorithms and a novel transport control protocol called TCP Peach  to realize practical satellite networks. He significantly contributed towards the development and realization of high altitude long operation (HALO) networks for providing broadband wireless network access which was implemented by Angel Technologies and Raytheon, exploited by invention disclosures (U.S. patent 6,756,937) and U.S. patent 7,027,769). HALO was the forerunner of the current UAVs and Drones and Cubesats research. Couple decades later many countries are working on the directions of the HALO project. This paper  is the first to comprehensively put forward the design principles and system reference model for HALO networks, which is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. With the extremely timely publication of the first and most comprehensive roadmap paper on wireless sensor networks, Akyildiz made this new research area known to the entire world. Many researchers, who work on sensor networks, has started by reading his paper. Hence, this publication has received more than 41,000 citations in 20 years. Moreover, this paper received the best tutorial paper award from IEEE Communications society in 2003. Thanks to his paper, the area has attracted significantly amplified attention and become focus of research and engineering efforts towards realizing wide range of sensor network applications.In 20 years, the research in this area has resulted in billions of dollars of investment from both government and private sector, educated thousands of students, and helped establish hundreds of companies. Dr. Akyildiz published many pioneering papers on wireless sensor networks. For example, in  the first reliable protocol (Event-to-Sink Reliable Transport -ESRT-) was introduced specifically tailored for the unique requirements and characteristics of wireless sensor networks. ESRT was devised based on the extremely novel and yet practical engineering notion of event-to-sink reliability, which leverages the inherent redundancy and spatio-temporal correlation in sensor networks to maximize the network lifetime. ESRT has also been taught in undergraduate and graduate level wireless networking courses at many universities. This work has been implemented in several simulation tools. The pioneering contributions to the field of wireless sensor networks was recognized as the IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award 2011. He is also the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks Technical Committee (AHSN TC) Technical Recognition Award based on his pioneering contributions to wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. Akyildiz was one of the first to introduce several advanced and next generation wireless sensor network paradigms and architectures to the research community including sensor and actor networks, multimedia sensor networks, underwater acoustic sensor networks, wireless underground sensor networks, underground magnetic sensor networks, along with the comprehensive list of open research issues and the first novel communication techniques. Preliminary version of this paper  received the best paper award from IEEE GlobeCom 2009 conference. The paper  became the flagpole paper that every researcher reads first as the first initiation into the field of CR networks during the heyday of the CR networks. The paper  had major impact as it is the first work which demonstrated the existence of optimal sensing parameters theoretically and developed the framework to support this optimality in real network environments. This paper identified the interference model for CR, well-motivated from the limitation of communication hardware that RF front-ends cannot differentiate between the transmissions of primary and secondary users. It developed a practical spectrum sensing solution, where an optimal observation time and a transmission time are determined to maximize sensing efficiency while satisfying interference limits. The paper  is the first research work that identifies the practical issues and derives possible solutions when extending the CR concept to cellular mobile networks. Specifically, this paper defined two mobility types in the CR cellular networks, user mobility and spectrum mobility. Akyildiz and his PhD students coined the word u201cCRAHNsu201d for the first time in, which is used as a standard terminology by the research community in the meantime. Specifically, this paper looked at the network architectures, where multiple nodes are not associated with a single controller (hence, called CR ad hoc networks or CRAHNs). Many practical networks can be built on top of such distributed architectures for consumer, military and disaster scenarios, with unpredictable spectrum availability. CRAHNS must operate in a dynamic environment where locations, spectrum availability, and neighboring forwarding nodes can change over time, and so are completely different from cellular networks. All these pioneering contributions lead to receive the prestigious IEEE ComSoc TCCN Recognition Award in 2017 by the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Cognitive Networks (TCCN) with citation ""for pioneering contributions to spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing algorithms and communication protocols for cognitive radio networks"". From the nano-device perspective, Akyildiz and his student Jornet proposed for the first time and investigated the use of graphene to develop nano-antennas for electromagnetic (EM) communication in nanonetworks in. This paper showed that, by using a narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR), an antenna just a few hundreds of nanometers long and tens of nanometers wide could radiate EM waves in the Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz). This framework is used to characterize the propagation characteristics of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in graphene. This work has become a foundation stone for EM nanonetworks and a US Patent was obtained for this technology in 2017. Akyildiz and Jornet also proposed a plasmonic nano-transceiver that intrinsically operate in the THz band in where the basic idea is based on the integration of III-V High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMT) with graphene in. In 2016, a US Patent is obtained for this technology. Akyildiz and his PhD student Jornet also developed very large plasmonic nano-antenna Planar Array with 32x32 (in total of 1024) elements which is called ""Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems"" in  and a patent was issued for this idea in 2017. While nanonetworks do not operate based on radio frequency spectrums, they mainly exploit networking paradigms which are fundamentally different yet u201cwirelessu201d such as molecular communication, where the information is coded and communicated by molecules as explored in  and the term u201cInternet of BioNanoThings: was coined in the paper  for the first time. Akyildiz and his student Pierobon also developed one of the first realistic molecular communication channel models and capacity analysis for molecular communication in. Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as one of the key wireless technologies of the next decade. The THz band will help to overcome the spectrum scarcity problems and capacity limitations of current wireless networks, by providing an unprecedentedly large bandwidth. In addition, THz-band communication will enable a plethora of long-awaited applications ranging from instantaneous massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks, to ultra-high-definition content streaming over mobile devices in 6G systems. The THz-band channel was investigated in  and the first channel model was developed for this almost unexplored frequency range. The peculiarities of the channel were captured by utilizing radiative transfer theory to account for the absorption from different types of gaseous molecules. In addition, he analytically calculated the channel capacity of the THz band for different medium compositions and power allocation schemes. Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. A radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments was first introduced in the VISORSURF project. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of two-dimensional metamaterials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation. Multiple tiles coat objects such as walls, furniture, and other objects in indoor and outdoor settings. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile to best fit the needs of communicating devices. A patent was acquired in January 2020. A novel cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, called the Internet of Space Things/CubeSats (IoST) is introduced in. IoST expands the functionalities of traditional IoT, by not only providing an always-available satellite backhaul network, but also by contributing real-time satellite-captured information and, more importantly, performing integration of on the ground data and satellite information to enable new applications. The fundamental building block for IoST is a new generation of nano-satellites known as CubeSats, which are augmented with Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) solutions.

Menczer holds a Laurea in physics from the Sapienza University of Rome and a PhD in computer science and cognitive science from the University of California, San Diego. He used to be an assistant professor of management sciences at the University of Iowa, and a fellow-at-large of the Santa Fe Institute. At Indiana University Bloomington since 2003, he served as division chair in the Luddy School in 2009u20132011. Menczer has been the recipient of Fulbright, Rotary Foundation, and NATO fellowships, and a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation. He holds editorial positions for the journals Network Science, EPJ Data Science, PeerJ Computer Science, and HKS Misinformation Review. He has served as program or track chair for various conferences including The Web Conference and the ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media. He was general chair of the ACM Web Science 2014 Conference and general co-chair of the NetSci 2017 Conference. Menczer's research focuses on Web science, social networks, social media, social computation, Web mining, data science, distributed and intelligent Web applications, and modeling of complex information networks. He introduced the idea of topical and adaptive Web crawlers, a specialized and intelligent type of Web crawler. Menczer is also known for his work on social phishing, a type of phishing attacks that leverage friendship information from social networks, yielding over 70% success rate in experiments (with Markus Jakobsson); semantic similarity measures for information and social networks; models of complex information and social networks (with Alessandro Vespignani and others); search engine censorship; and search engine bias. The group led by Menczer has analyzed and modeled how memes, information, and misinformation spread through social media in domains such as the Occupy movement, the Gezi Park protests, and political elections. Data and tools from Menczer's lab have aided in finding the roots of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the disinformation campaign targeting the White Helmets, and in taking down voter-suppression bots on Twitter. Menczer and coauthors have also found a link between online COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Analysis by Menczer's team demonstrated the echo-chamber structure of information-diffusion networks on Twitter during the 2010 United States elections. The team found that conservatives almost exclusively retweeted other conservatives while liberals retweeted other liberals. Ten years later, this work received the Test of Time Award at the 15th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). As these patterns of polarization and segregation persist, Menczer's team has developed a model that shows how social influence and unfollowing accelerate the emergence of online echo chambers. Menczer and colleagues have advanced the understanding of information virality, and in particular the prediction of what memes will go viral based on the structure of early diffusion networks and how competition for finite attention helps explain virality patterns. In a 2018 paper in Nature Human Behaviour, Menczer and coauthors used a model to show that when agents in a social networks share information under conditions of high information load and/or low attention, the correlation between quality and popularity of information in the system decreases. An erroneous analysis in the paper suggested that this effect alone would be sufficient to explain why fake news are as likely to go viral as legitimate news on Facebook. When the authors discovered the error, they retracted the paper. Following influential publications on the detection of astroturfing and social bots, Menczer and his team have studied the complex interplay between cognitive, social, and algorithmic factors that contribute to the vulnerability of social media platforms and people to manipulation, and focused on developing tools to counter such abuse. Their bot detection tool, Botometer, was used to assess the prevalence of social bots and their sharing activity. Their tool to visualize the spread of low-credibility content, Hoaxy, was used in conjunction with Botometer to reveal the key role played by social bots in spreading low-credibility content during the 2016 United States presidential election. Menczer's team also studied perceptions of partisan political bots, finding that Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots. Using bot probes on Twitter, Menczer and coauthors demonstrated a conservative political bias on the platform. As social media have increased their countermeasures against malicious automated accounts, Menczer and coauthors have shown that coordinated campaigns by inauthentic accounts continue to threaten information integrity on social media, and developed a framework to detect these coordinated networks. They also demonstrated new forms of social media manipulation by which bad actors can grow influence networks and hide high-volume of content with which they flood the network. Menczer and colleagues have shown that political audience diversity can be used as an indicator of news source reliability in algorithmic ranking. The textbook A First Course in Network Science by Menczer, Fortunato, and Davis was published by Cambridge University Press in 2020. The textbook has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, and Korean."

His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled u201cMultiprocessor Systems with Process Communicationu201d where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur. His paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes. Based on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in. He published many other papers on queuing network models. These contributions lead him to obtain the IEEE Fellow rank in 1996, and in particular  to performance analysis of computer communication networks. In 1997 Ian Akyildiz with his colleagues at the YURIE  systems designed and implemented the first adaptive forward-error-correction solution on the link layer of their wireless ATM switch providing high reliability in wireless ATM networks with very low bit data rates used in battlefield scenarios. A patent for this solution was obtained in 2006 U.S. patent 7,058,027. A technical paper describing the link layer design on this low bit rate wireless ATM switch was published. The founder of the Yurie Systems, Jeong H. Kim, received the entrepreneur of the year award in 1997 and Yurie Systems was acquired by Lucent for 1 Billion US Dollars in 1998. Ian Akyildiz significantly contributed to mobility and resource management of 2G and 3G cellular systems in the 90s. He proposed many handoff management, location registration, and paging schemes for the design of 3G and 4G wireless systems, and all of his papers have been published in top notch journals and conferences between 1998 and 2000. His paper titled u201cMobility Management in Next-Generation Wireless Systemsu201d was invited to be included in Proceedings of IEEE, and is the most cited paper on mobility management in the literature, and became u201ctheu201d main reading material for the first course on mobile networks in many universities. His contributions to mobility and resource management gained him the ACM Fellow rank in 1997. Ian Akyildiz started to use the notion u201c4Gu201d wireless networks in 1999-2000 through his papers and keynote speeches. He clearly pointed out the requirements for heterogeneous 4G wireless systems, such as anywhere/anytime wireless connectivity with hundreds of Mbps bandwidth per mobile user for both data and multimedia services. Consequently, the first adaptive protocol suite framework for Next Generation Wireless Internet was supported by NSF (National Science Foundation) (2000-2005) NSF #:ANI-0117840. His early insights on the need to enable a single mobile terminal to seamlessly communicate over heterogeneous wireless access systems such as wireless LANs, 3G cellular networks, and satellite networks are seminal contributions to 4G systems.These ideas were the forerunner of the dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio networks. The culmination of his research work on this topic gained him the 2003 ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award for his ""pioneering contributions in the area of mobility and resource management for wireless communication networks"", in September 2003. Akyildiz, in collaboration and with support of NASA, developed several routing algorithms and a novel transport control protocol called TCP Peach  to realize practical satellite networks. He significantly contributed towards the development and realization of high altitude long operation (HALO) networks for providing broadband wireless network access which was implemented by Angel Technologies and Raytheon, exploited by invention disclosures (U.S. patent 6,756,937) and U.S. patent 7,027,769). HALO was the forerunner of the current UAVs and Drones and Cubesats research. Couple decades later many countries are working on the directions of the HALO project. This paper  is the first to comprehensively put forward the design principles and system reference model for HALO networks, which is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. With the extremely timely publication of the first and most comprehensive roadmap paper on wireless sensor networks, Akyildiz made this new research area known to the entire world. Many researchers, who work on sensor networks, has started by reading his paper. Hence, this publication has received more than 41,000 citations in 20 years. Moreover, this paper received the best tutorial paper award from IEEE Communications society in 2003. Thanks to his paper, the area has attracted significantly amplified attention and become focus of research and engineering efforts towards realizing wide range of sensor network applications.In 20 years, the research in this area has resulted in billions of dollars of investment from both government and private sector, educated thousands of students, and helped establish hundreds of companies. Dr. Akyildiz published many pioneering papers on wireless sensor networks. For example, in  the first reliable protocol (Event-to-Sink Reliable Transport -ESRT-) was introduced specifically tailored for the unique requirements and characteristics of wireless sensor networks. ESRT was devised based on the extremely novel and yet practical engineering notion of event-to-sink reliability, which leverages the inherent redundancy and spatio-temporal correlation in sensor networks to maximize the network lifetime. ESRT has also been taught in undergraduate and graduate level wireless networking courses at many universities. This work has been implemented in several simulation tools. The pioneering contributions to the field of wireless sensor networks was recognized as the IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award 2011. He is also the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks Technical Committee (AHSN TC) Technical Recognition Award based on his pioneering contributions to wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. Akyildiz was one of the first to introduce several advanced and next generation wireless sensor network paradigms and architectures to the research community including sensor and actor networks, multimedia sensor networks, underwater acoustic sensor networks, wireless underground sensor networks, underground magnetic sensor networks, along with the comprehensive list of open research issues and the first novel communication techniques. Preliminary version of this paper  received the best paper award from IEEE GlobeCom 2009 conference. The paper  became the flagpole paper that every researcher reads first as the first initiation into the field of CR networks during the heyday of the CR networks. The paper  had major impact as it is the first work which demonstrated the existence of optimal sensing parameters theoretically and developed the framework to support this optimality in real network environments. This paper identified the interference model for CR, well-motivated from the limitation of communication hardware that RF front-ends cannot differentiate between the transmissions of primary and secondary users. It developed a practical spectrum sensing solution, where an optimal observation time and a transmission time are determined to maximize sensing efficiency while satisfying interference limits. The paper  is the first research work that identifies the practical issues and derives possible solutions when extending the CR concept to cellular mobile networks. Specifically, this paper defined two mobility types in the CR cellular networks, user mobility and spectrum mobility. Akyildiz and his PhD students coined the word u201cCRAHNsu201d for the first time in, which is used as a standard terminology by the research community in the meantime. Specifically, this paper looked at the network architectures, where multiple nodes are not associated with a single controller (hence, called CR ad hoc networks or CRAHNs). Many practical networks can be built on top of such distributed architectures for consumer, military and disaster scenarios, with unpredictable spectrum availability. CRAHNS must operate in a dynamic environment where locations, spectrum availability, and neighboring forwarding nodes can change over time, and so are completely different from cellular networks. All these pioneering contributions lead to receive the prestigious IEEE ComSoc TCCN Recognition Award in 2017 by the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Cognitive Networks (TCCN) with citation ""for pioneering contributions to spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing algorithms and communication protocols for cognitive radio networks"". From the nano-device perspective, Akyildiz and his student Jornet proposed for the first time and investigated the use of graphene to develop nano-antennas for electromagnetic (EM) communication in nanonetworks in. This paper showed that, by using a narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR), an antenna just a few hundreds of nanometers long and tens of nanometers wide could radiate EM waves in the Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz). This framework is used to characterize the propagation characteristics of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in graphene. This work has become a foundation stone for EM nanonetworks and a US Patent was obtained for this technology in 2017. Akyildiz and Jornet also proposed a plasmonic nano-transceiver that intrinsically operate in the THz band in where the basic idea is based on the integration of III-V High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMT) with graphene in. In 2016, a US Patent is obtained for this technology. Akyildiz and his PhD student Jornet also developed very large plasmonic nano-antenna Planar Array with 32x32 (in total of 1024) elements which is called ""Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems"" in  and a patent was issued for this idea in 2017. While nanonetworks do not operate based on radio frequency spectrums, they mainly exploit networking paradigms which are fundamentally different yet u201cwirelessu201d such as molecular communication, where the information is coded and communicated by molecules as explored in  and the term u201cInternet of BioNanoThings: was coined in the paper  for the first time. Akyildiz and his student Pierobon also developed one of the first realistic molecular communication channel models and capacity analysis for molecular communication in. Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as one of the key wireless technologies of the next decade. The THz band will help to overcome the spectrum scarcity problems and capacity limitations of current wireless networks, by providing an unprecedentedly large bandwidth. In addition, THz-band communication will enable a plethora of long-awaited applications ranging from instantaneous massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks, to ultra-high-definition content streaming over mobile devices in 6G systems. The THz-band channel was investigated in  and the first channel model was developed for this almost unexplored frequency range. The peculiarities of the channel were captured by utilizing radiative transfer theory to account for the absorption from different types of gaseous molecules. In addition, he analytically calculated the channel capacity of the THz band for different medium compositions and power allocation schemes. Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. A radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments was first introduced in the VISORSURF project. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of two-dimensional metamaterials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation. Multiple tiles coat objects such as walls, furniture, and other objects in indoor and outdoor settings. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile to best fit the needs of communicating devices. A patent was acquired in January 2020. A novel cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, called the Internet of Space Things/CubeSats (IoST) is introduced in. IoST expands the functionalities of traditional IoT, by not only providing an always-available satellite backhaul network, but also by contributing real-time satellite-captured information and, more importantly, performing integration of on the ground data and satellite information to enable new applications. The fundamental building block for IoST is a new generation of nano-satellites known as CubeSats, which are augmented with Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) solutions.

After moving to the United States, he received MSc in computer science (1991) from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and his PhD in computer science (1997) from the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). The system works by extracting a unique biometric signature of a person's face based on combination of 3D shape, texture, infrared, and time variables. While earlier face recognition methods have focused on appearance - capturing, representing, and matching facial characteristics as they appear on 2D images in the visible spectrum, the proposed URxD system uses a webcam to capture a continuous video stream which is used to detect whether a person is facing the 3D camera, and if the subject is facing the camera relatively still for more than two seconds, the system triggers the optical scanner and the 3D data are captured. It can also determine whether the person is wearing glasses. The system has achieved the best published results when tried to 4,007 datasets as a part of the international face recognition Grand Challenge organized by NIST in 2007.[citation needed]"

Klir Professor of Systems Science at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science, Binghamton University (State University of New York). He has been director of the NSF-NRT Complex Networks and Systems graduate Program in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He is also director of the Center for Social and Biomedical Complexity, between Binghamton University and Indiana University, Bloomington, a Fulbright Scholar, and Principal Investigator at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal. His research is on complex systems and networks, computational and systems biology, biomedical complexity and digital health, and computational intelligence (including Artificial Life and Embodied Cognition). He was born in Luanda, Angola, moving to Lisbon, Portugal in his teens and completing an Licentiate (B.A. plus M.S.) in Mechanical and Systems Engineering at the Instituto Superior Tu00e9cnico. He received his Ph.D in Systems Science in 1997 from the  Binghamton University. From 1998 to 2004 he was a staff scientist at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he founded and led a Complex Systems Modeling Team during 1998-2002, and was part of the Santa Fe Institute research community. He has been the director of the NSF-NRT Interdisciplinary Training Program in Complex Networks and Systems, and Professor of Informatics in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, where he was a member of the advisory council of the Indiana University Network Science Institute, and core faculty of the Cognitive Science Program.  From 2005 to 2015 he was the director of the  Computational Biology Collaboratorium and in the Direction of the PhD program in Computational Biology at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, where he remains a Principal Investigator. He has organized the Tenth International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems (Alife X) and the Ninth European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2007). Dr. Rocha studies the systems properties of natural and artificial systems which enable them to adapt and evolve. He has approached this general topic by investigating how information and redundancy are fundamental for controlling the behavior and evolutionary capabilities of complex systems, as well as abstracting principles from natural systems to produce adaptive information technology. Accepting Von Neumann's principle of self-replication and Turing's universal computation as a general principle for generating open-ended complexity that encompasses Natural Selection, Dr. Rocha has developed the work of Howard Pattee, Sydney Brenner, and others who regard computation and information as fundamental to understanding life, cognition and other complex systems (a good overview is Gleick's Book). From this viewpoint, he has approached several questions: how do cells and collectives of cells compute? Is language an evolutionary system operating under the same principle? Can artificial systems implement the same principle? Namely, can collective intelligence on the web become a super-organism implementing this principle?  From these questions, he has worked on various specific research projects ranging from Biomedical Literature Mining and Social Media Mining to understanding redundancy, robustness, modularity and control in Complex Networks, Collective Intelligence on the Web and in Social Systems, and Agent-based models of Evolutionary Systems such as RNA Editing and Artificial Immune Systems. Rocha is a proponent of embodied and situated cognition and has defended the grounded epistemological stance of evolutionary constructivism. He is a proponent of the view that the threshold of complexity required for open-ended evolution requires an interplay between symbolic memory and dynamical machinery, i.e. a strict genotype-phenotype separation. This idea has been labeled  semiotic closure and is generally understood to fit in the area of biosemiotics. He has defended that this principle of organization is at play in cognition and human collective behavior, having developed web technology to implement the principle. In addition to scientific work often mentioned in the media, he regularly publishes opinion articles in the popular media to disseminate scientific thinking."

Jenkins works on humanu2013computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariu0107 on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Jenkins serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction."

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory. Lasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society ""for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies."" Her specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization. Irena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study. After receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of. Optimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions. The work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations. Control Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, "" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance."" In simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal, and feedback is the mapping from outputs to inputs. This can be applied to many facets of real-life, especially in various engineering fields that concentrate on the control of changes in their field. A good example of control theory applied to the real world is something as simple as a thermostat. The output in this system is temperature, and the control is turning the dial on or off, or to a higher or lower temperature. Lasiecka uses this theory to further understand partial differential equations. She attempts to answer the questions of how to take advantage of a model in order to improve the system's performance. This idea is paired her desire to understand mathematical solutions of the problems of well-posedness and regularity, stabilization and stability, and optimal control for finite or infinite horizon problems and existence and uniqueness of associated Riccati equations. In Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, Lasiecka studies this concept through waves and hyperbolic models. This book was written in order to ""help engineers and professionals involved in materials science and aerospace engineering to solve fundamental theoretical control problems. Applied mathematicians and theoretical engineers with an interest in the mathematical quantitative analysis will find this text useful.""  Irena has written and edited numerous research journals and articles in addition to the above books."

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics. Stanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962. He performed biological physics research with Max Delbru00fcck in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967. Stanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph  Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971. Stanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden. Stanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nu00e0 infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks. His seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed with Texeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume [H. E. Stanley and J. Teixeira, u201cInterpretation of The Unusual Behavior of H2O and D2O at Low Temperatures: Tests of a Percolation Modelu201d J. Chem. Phys. 73, 3404u20133422 (1980)]. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of wateru2019s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford. Stanley coined the term u2018econophysicsu2019 in 1994 to denote the field of physics dealing with economic phenomena. His group has found empirical laws governing economic fluctuations, and proposed statistical mechanics models to explain their origins.   The ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201. Stanley is committed to education at all levels, from high school to graduate studies.  He has served as thesis advisor to 114 Ph.D. students and has collaborated with 211 postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. He is also active in worldwide efforts for achieving gender balance in the physical sciences. Stanley has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2004), the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.  He is an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Physical Society. He is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), and at Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest, Hungary).  Stanley awarded the 2004 APS Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, ""For his extraordinary contributions to human rights, for his initiatives on behalf of female physicists, and for his caring and supportive relationship with those who have worked in his laboratory."" For his contributions to phase transitions Stanley received the 2004 Boltzmann Medal, awarded by International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the American Physical Society 2008 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize. He was awarded the Teresiana Medal in Complex Systems Research given by the University of Pavia.  He also received the Distinguished Teaching Scholar  Director's Award from the National Science Foundation, the Nicholson Medal for Human Outreach from the American Physical Society, a Guggenheim Fellowship (1979), the David Turnbull Prize from the Materials Research Society (1998), a BP Venture Research Award, the Floyd K. Richtmyer Memorial Lectureship Award (1997), the Memory Ride Award for Alzheimer Research, and the Massachusetts Professor of the Year awarded by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Stanley has received nine Doctorates Honoris Causa, from Bar-Ilan University Ramat Gan, (Israel), Eu00f6tvu00f6s Loru00e1nd University (Budapest). University of Liu00e8ge (Belgium),[citation needed] University of Dortmund, University of Wroclaw, Northwestern University, University of Messina, University of Leicester, and the IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca."
