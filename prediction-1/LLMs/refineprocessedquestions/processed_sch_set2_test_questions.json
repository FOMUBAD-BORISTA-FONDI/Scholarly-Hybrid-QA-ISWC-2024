Hinze co-led, with Judy Bowen and Rangi Mātāmua, a research project to develop a hi-tech vest for forestry workers, aimed at detecting signs of fatigue and thus reducing injury. The vest would contain sensors to monitor vital signs, but the data would be challenging to analyse as it would be continuously streaming, but in a forestry environment, researchers would need to allow for data drop-out and unexpected actions by workers. \n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nAnnika Hinze; Kai Sachs; Alejandro Buchmann (2009), Event-based applications and enabling technologies, doi:10.1145/1619258.1619260, Wikidata Q59550114\nAnnika Hinze; Agnès Voisard (2003). \"Location- and Time-Based Information Delivery in Tourism\".

He is the Dean of the University of Washington Information School. Dey is formerly the director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie at the intersection of human–computer interaction and ubiquitous computing, focusing on how to make novel technologies more usable and useful. In particular, he builds tools that make it easier to build useful ubiquitous computing applications and supporting end users in controlling their ubiquitous computing systems.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDey was born in Canada and now resides in Seattle, Washington. Dey received a Bachelor of Applied Science in computer engineering from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada in 1993. He received a Master of Science in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech in 1995 and then went on to complete a second master's degree and a Ph.D. in computer science, also at Georgia Tech, in 2000. For his dissertation, he researched programming support for building context-aware applications: The Context Toolkit. He was a member of the Future Computing Environments research group in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHis research interests are feedback and control in ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing, toolkits and end-user programming environments, sensor-rich environments, information overload, ambient displays, privacy, human-computer interaction.  He is among the most prolific authors in computer science and human-computer interaction.\n\n\n=== Ubiquitous computing ===\nMuch of Dey's research deals with the construction and intersectional nature of ubiquitous computing. In 2002, in a research project at the University of California, Berkeley alongside Scott Lederer and Jennifer Mankoff, the team developed a conceptual model exploring the tangibility and accessibility of everyday end-user privacy in ubicomp environments. The model takes considerations from societal influences, contextual factors, and subjectivity to develop a far-reaching scope for ubicomp privacy. The model was then used to explore an interactional metaphor called situational faces, which makes the issue of privacy in ubiquitous computing environments more accessible to users. This facade presents an abstraction of advanced privacy settings to allow users to more easily establish their preferences.\n\n\n=== Smart homes and intelligent environments ===\nIn 2006, Dey developed a research paper alongside Min Kyung Lee, Scott Davidoff, and John Zimmerman, all of Carnegie Mellon University, exploring and evaluating the usage of home automation technology and their effects on family life. As a collaboration between the School of Design and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the research sought to uncover areas of human-centered design that could complement family life, thus providing insight on the potential roles a smart home could play. Following a heuristic design process, the team interviewed dual-income families in their own homes, gauging  cultural and ethnographic information, leading to the generation and experimentation of a design concept. The study concluded that such accommodations would allow families to avoid breakdowns in developed routines and improve emotional connectivity between family members and the home, while allowing parents to devote more time and attention to children.\n\n\n=== Context awareness and self-monitoring technologies ===\nIn 2010, Dey, alongside Dana Pavel and V..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

Aylett (born 1951) is a British author, computer scientist, professor, poet and political activist. She is a professor of computer science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, where she specialises in affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAylett's research involves affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction. She is the leader of Socially Competent Robots (SoCoRo), a project of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council that studies whether robots can assist autistic people in learning to recognize facial expressions and other social cues.\nShe has also studied the use of \"emotionally literate\" robots for tutoring schoolchildren, developed interactive role-playing software intended to combat bullying, and performed with a robot poet named Sarah the Poetic Robot as part of the Edinburgh Free Fringe.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAylett earned a degree in mathematical economics at the London School of Economics, and began her career in computing by working in technical support at International Computers Limited for three years, before moving to the University of Sheffield to work in computing and robotics. She became a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University for five years, and then moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1989, as part of the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute there. She moved again to the University of Salford in 1992, first as part of the IT Institute there and later in the Centre for Virtual Environments. There, she became Professor of Intelligent Virtual Environments in 2000. In 2004, she moved to her present position at Heriot-Watt University.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAylett's book Robots: Bringing Intelligent Machines to Life? (2002) is a historical exploration on robots, on the history of robotics, and on research problems confronting roboticists. Aimed at high-school age students, it consists of a sequence of two-page illustrated spreads on each of its topics.\nShe is the coauthor, with Judy Robertson, Lisa Gjedde, Rose Luckin and Paul Brna, of the self-published book Inside Stories: A Narrative Journey (2008), on the use of story-telling in education and the use of technology to assist in storytelling.\nAylett is also the coauthor of the poetry pamphlet Handfast: Poetry Duets with Beth McDonough (Mothers Milk, 2016). It has a challenge-response format, in which a poem by one of the authors inspires a poem by the other author exploring the same theme.\n\n\n== Family and politics ==\nAylett was born in London. She is the mother of writer and activist Owen Jones. She met her husband, union organiser Robert Jones, through their membership in the Militant tendency, a Trotskyist group within the Labour Party. He developed prostate cancer, and died in 2018.\nAs a political activist, Aylett has advocated for the Labour Party, for improved labour security for university staff, for permanent residency for European Union citizens already in the UK at the time of Brexit, for academic freedom for faculty and students in the face of the 'Counter-terrorism and security bill' legislation by signing a letter claiming the bill ran counter to universities mission to foster free speech as well as being 'unenforceable' and 'unlawful', as well as support for transgender rights. She has served as one of the leaders of the Labour Party in Edinburgh Southern.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nRut..."

He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993.\n\n\n== Research and philosophy ==\nProfessor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the Information Age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\"\nDay's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDay has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006.\nDay's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence.\nIn 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data..."

In 1991 he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was appointed Professor of Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. He is also Senior Fellow in the Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto.\nHe is elected Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and elected fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advance Research.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFox's current research interests concern smart cities, in particular \"ontologies for modelling cities and their performance, causal analysis of crowd sourced data (e.g., analysis of reports provided by citizens to the city), and process mapping and analysis of city services (e.g., social services).\"\nIn the past he has been particularly interested the fields of \"enterprise engineering (i.e., information technology for business process engineering), constrained-directed reasoning, a unified theory of scheduling, enterprise modelling (i.e., TOVE) and coordination theory.\"\n\n\n=== TOVE project ===\n\nThe TOVE project, acronym of TOronto Virtual Enterprise project is a project to develop an ontological framework for enterprise integration (EI) based on and suited for enterprise modeling. In the beginning of the 1990s it was initiated by Mark S. Fox and others at the University of Toronto . Initially the project had defined four goals:\n\nprovides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,\ndefines the meaning of each term (aka semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as possible\nimplements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable TOVE to automatically deduce the answer to many \"common sense\" questions about the enterprise, and\ndefines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical context.\nThe TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering.\n\n\n=== Enterprise modeling ===\nIn the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Grüninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating:\n\nIn enterprise modelling, we want to define the actions performed within an enterprise, and define constraints for plans and schedules which are constructed to satisfy the goals of the enterprise.

His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government.\nOn 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.\nGisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title “Club of the Year” by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1995, Gisin transmitted a quantum cryptographic signal at a distance of 23 km over a commercial optical fiber under Lake Geneva. Later, his group extended this record to 67 km  and 307 km  using Plug-&-Play and Coherent One Way configurations for quantum key distribution.\nIn 1997, Nicolas Gisin and his group demonstrated Bell inequality violations at a distance of over 10 km. This was the first time when quantum non-locality was demonstrated outside the lab; the distance was increased by about three orders of magnitude with respect to all previous experiments. This was followed by further experiments, ever strengthening the conclusion by excluding more and more sophisticated alternative models to quantum theory.\nIn the early 2000s he was the first in demonstrating quantum teleportation over long distances. In the latter experiment the receiving photon was hundreds of meters away when the Bell state measurement that triggers the teleportation process was performed.\nThe previous breakthroughs would not have been possible without single-photon detectors compatible with telecommunication optical fibers. When Gisin entered the field such detectors did not exist. Today, thanks to Gisin and his group at the University of Geneva, single-photon detectors at telecom wavelengths are commercially available.\nNicolas Gisin’s work pushed optical fiber quantum communication almo..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (s, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (c, = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (Φ, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (w). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\", for example   \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for   S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            \n                              |\n                            \n                            \n                              \n                                |\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    NCS 1950\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Standard\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n    ..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

As the political conflict in Argentina increased, Dahl attended graduate school in  France. In 1977, she was the first graduate at the Université d'Aix-Marseille to receive a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile involved in the research for her doctorate, Dahl became a pioneer in the field of logic programming, developing both the first logic programming database system, and an (also logic-programmed) front end to consult it in a human language (Spanish). Dahl's research and methodologies became multi-disciplinary including Computational Linguistics, Computational Molecular Biology, and Artificial Intelligence. She became an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1991. In 1996 she was honoured by the Logic Programming Association as one of the 15 founders of the Logic Programming Field, and has extensively pioneered as well the areas of Logic Grammars and Constraint Handling Rules.\nDahl is a woman pioneer in a male-dominated field. She fought gender inequality while she was a professor at Simon Fraser University, both through mentoring and role modelling, and through concrete actions. After Simon Fraser University refused to reimburse her $17 for childcare expenses while she was delivering a guest speech in Victoria, where she’d traveled with her nursing baby, she went first to her department and then Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) with her protest, which ended with the NSERC changing their policy to make childcare a covered expense for nursing researchers they funded. She proposed and actively promoted the provision of childcare at logic programming conferences, until it was adopted formally into their constitution, and is now routinely offered as a result. She also obtained a change in SFU's legislation when it resulted in her graduate student being timed out for delays caused by life-threatening medical conditions upon birthing twins.\nShe has developed numerous international research projects and collaborations, most notably with Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France, and worked with IBM, Vancouver Software Labs, International Artificial Intelligence. In her work with IBM, she obtained a record-breaking research contract. She served as president of the Association of Logic Programming from 2001-2005. She was awarded the prestigious Marie Curie Chair of Excellence 2008-2011 from the European Commission for her pioneering work on Constraint Solving and Language Processing for Bioinformatics.

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

Nakhleh (Arabic): لؤي نخله; born May 8, 1974) is a Palestinian-Israeli-American computer scientist and computational biologist who is the William and Stephanie Sick Dean of the George R. Brown School of Engineering, a professor of Computer Science and a professor of BioSciences at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNakhleh was born on May 8, 1974, to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds both U.S. and Israeli citizenship.\nNakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. Tandy Warnow, in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, and became a Full Professor in 2016.  He served as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science from July 2018 until December 2020. Nakhleh served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Rice University from 2017 to 2020.\nIn addition to his duties as the Dean of Engineering at Rice University, Nakhleh currently teaches courses in discrete mathematics and computational biology. Nakhleh has received high acclaim at Rice University for his skills in teaching, and he is the recipient of many awards in this area.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nNakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and comparative genomics under \nscenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious phylogenetic networks: networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to reticulate evolution. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) \nevolutionary history of the Indo-European languages. Their paper on perfect phylogenetic networks was included as one of the 20 best papers published in Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America, in the 30-year period 1986–2016.\nLater, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably incomplete lineage sorting. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies coalescent with gene flow.\nAdditionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics.\nNakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet, an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nNakhleh's honors and awards include:\n\nThe National Science Foundation CAREER Award, 2009.\nThe Sloan Fellowship in the Molecular Biology category, 2010.\nThe Guggenheim Fellowship in the Organismic Biology and Ecology category, 2012.\n\n\n== References ==..."

She is the Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. She is known as a founder of the fields of rescue robotics and human-robot interaction and for inserting robots into disasters. Her case studies of how unmanned systems under perform in the field led cognitive systems engineering researcher David Woods to pose the (Robin) Murphy's Law of Autonomy: a deployment of robotic systems will fall short of the target level of autonomy, creating or exacerbating a shortfall in mechanisms for coordination with human problem holders. Her TED talk “These Robots Come to the Rescue After a Disaster” was listed in TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking as one of the examples of a good TED talk. Murphy is also known for using science fiction as an innovative method of teaching artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\n\n== Early years and education ==\nMurphy was raised in Douglas, Georgia. She received her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1980, worked in the process safety industry, and returned to Georgia Tech for a master's (1988) and PhD. (1992) in computer science under the direction of Ronald Arkin. She was the first person to graduate from the Georgia Tech College of Computing with a PhD in robotics. She was an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines from 1992 to 1998, then moved to the University of South Florida as an associate professor in 1998 and was promoted to full professor in 2003. In 2008, Murphy moved to Texas A&M University. She was a member of the Defense Science Study Group from 1997 to 1998; this led to her involvement on numerous science boards, including the Defense Science Board and the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board.\n\n\n== Career in robotics ==\n\n\n=== Disaster robotics ===\nMurphy began research into disaster robotics in 1995, motivated by the Oklahoma City bombing.  Murphy was the director of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASASR)  from 2002 to 2018, and now serves as the vice-president. Through CRASAR she participated in the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster (2001), considered the first use of robots for the emergency response phase of a disaster. Since then she has helped insert unmanned ground, aerial, and marine systems into 27 disasters including Hurricane Katrina, which is considered the first use of small unmanned aerial systems, the Fukishima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011), the Tōhoku tsunami (2011),  the Syrian Boat Refugee crisis (2016), and Hurricane Harvey (2017). She wrote the seminal text Disaster Robotics, MIT Press, in 2014.\n\n\n=== Science fiction ===\nMurphy's book, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Robotics: Case Studies of Successful Systems  was cited by Michael Crichton in Prey.\nShe inspired the character of Jae, a rescue roboticist who worked at Disaster City, in Skinner, a science fiction book by Charlie Huston.\nMurphy has edited a book, Robotics Through Science Fiction: Artificial Intelligence Explained Through Six Classic Robot Short Stories by Isaac Asimov, Brian Aldiss, Vernor Vinge, and Philip K. Dick, to illustrate key principles in programming artificial intelligence for robotics. The book was originally intended as a companion to the second edition of her textbook Introduction to AI Robotics but it serves as a stand-alone book for a non-technical audience.\nSince 2018, she writes monthly 'sc..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

Bruce Croft is a distinguished professor of computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst whose work focuses on information retrieval.\nHe is the founder of the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval and served as the editor-in-chief of ACM Transactions on Information Systems from 1995 to 2002.  He was also a member of the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board from 2000 to 2003. Since 2015, he is the Dean of the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was Chair of the UMass Amherst Computer Science Department from 2001 to 2007.\nBruce Croft formed the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) in 1991, since when he and his students have worked with more than 90 industry and government partners on research and technology projects and have produced more than 900 papers. Bruce Croft has made major contributions to most areas of information retrieval, including pioneering work in clustering, passage retrieval, sentence retrieval, and distributed search. One of the most important areas of work for Croft  relates to ranking functions and retrieval models, where he has led the development of one of the major approaches to modeling search: language modelling. In later years, Croft also led the way in the development of feature-based ranking functions. Croft and his research group have also developed a series of search engines: InQuery, the Lemur toolkit, Indri, and Galago. These search engines are open source and offer unique capabilities that are not replicated in other research retrieval platforms source – consequently they are downloaded by hundreds of researchers world wide. As a consequence of his work, Croft is one of the most cited researchers in information retrieval.\n\n\n== Education ==\nCroft earned a bachelor's degree with honors in 1973 and a master's degree in computer science in 1974 from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

It builds on previous research linking language patterns with mental states and traits but is more efficient and objective than hand coding methods. Pennebaker and his collaborators have used LIWC to analyze the language of Al Qaeda leaders and of political candidates, particularly in the 2008 United States presidential election. The use of LIWC is widespread, particularly in the social-behavioral and computer sciences. It is commonly used to examine group and individual differences in communication and writing, the influence of context on language use, social dynamics in close relationships, and language patterns associated with deception and insider threats.

His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government.\nOn 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.\nGisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title “Club of the Year” by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1995, Gisin transmitted a quantum cryptographic signal at a distance of 23 km over a commercial optical fiber under Lake Geneva. Later, his group extended this record to 67 km  and 307 km  using Plug-&-Play and Coherent One Way configurations for quantum key distribution.\nIn 1997, Nicolas Gisin and his group demonstrated Bell inequality violations at a distance of over 10 km. This was the first time when quantum non-locality was demonstrated outside the lab; the distance was increased by about three orders of magnitude with respect to all previous experiments. This was followed by further experiments, ever strengthening the conclusion by excluding more and more sophisticated alternative models to quantum theory.\nIn the early 2000s he was the first in demonstrating quantum teleportation over long distances. In the latter experiment the receiving photon was hundreds of meters away when the Bell state measurement that triggers the teleportation process was performed.\nThe previous breakthroughs would not have been possible without single-photon detectors compatible with telecommunication optical fibers. When Gisin entered the field such detectors did not exist. Today, thanks to Gisin and his group at the University of Geneva, single-photon detectors at telecom wavelengths are commercially available.\nNicolas Gisin’s work pushed optical fiber quantum communication almo..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

There, he holds the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Chair in Information and Computer Science.  Savage is widely cited in computer security, particularly in the areas of email spam, network worms and malware propagation, distributed denial of service (DDOS) mitigation and traceback, automotive hacking and wireless security. He received his undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington (2002).\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published \"Sting\", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement.\nIn 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems.\nIn 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks. Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer.\nIn 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network.\nIn 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were \"propagating\", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005.\nIn 2005, Ishwar Ramani and Stefan Savage developed Syncscan algorithm that cuts the time needed to switch between Wi-Fi access points.\nIn 2004, Savage was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship, in 2010 he was named a Fe..."

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201.\nStanley..."

Day\nAffiliation: Indiana University Bloomington\nNumerical metrics:\n- hIndex: 18\n- i10Index: 23\n- Authors_Cited by count: 889\n- Authors_Works count: 125\n- Two-year mean citedness: 0.20000000298023223877\n\nInstitution: Indiana University Bloomington\nType: education\nLocation: US\nNumerical metrics:\n- Institution_Cited by count: 2713018\n- Institution_Works count: 77019\nHomepage: http://www.indiana.edu/\n\nAdditional information: Ronald E. Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRonald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993.\n\n\n== Research and philosophy ==\nProfessor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the Information Age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\"\nDay's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDay has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006.\nDay's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence.\nIn 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data..."

He has been a Fellow of Keble College, Oxford, since 1985 and was elected a foreign associate member of the French Academy of Sciences in 2015. He was formerly BP Professor of Information Engineering at Oxford from 1985 to 2010 and a senior research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 1980 to 1985.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBrady was educated in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, where he was awarded a first class Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1966 followed by a Master of Science degree in 1968. He went on to study at the Australian National University, where he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1970 for research into group theory supervised by László György Kovács.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nBrady is an authority in the field of image analysis, initially working on shape analysis while at MIT, then on robotics, but most of all with an emphasis on medical image analysis. At MIT he worked on: the multiscale representation of the bounding contours of shapes (the curvature primal sketch), with Haruo Asada (Toshiba); two dimensional shapes (smoothed local symmetries), with Jon Connell; and the application of differential geometry to three-dimensional data, with Jean Ponce and Demetri Terzopoulos. He also worked on texture with Alan Yuille. He also worked with John M. Hollerbach, Tomàs Lozano-Pérez, and Matt Mason on robotics, who together published an early influential collection of articles and founded a seminal series of conferences.\nArriving in Oxford in 1985, he established the Robotics Laboratory and recruited Andrew Blake, Andrew Zisserman, Stephen Cameron, Hugh Durrant-Whyte, Lionel Tarassenko, Alison Noble, and David Murray. His initial focus was on mobile robotics, where he worked closely with Huosheng Hu Jan Grothusen, Stephen Smith, Mark Jenkinson, and Ian Reid. This was a collaboration with GEC Electrical Products and led in 1991 to the formation of Guidance Navigation Systems Ltd.  The primary interest of this work was sensor data fusion and the real-time detection of obstacles in a robot vehicle's planned path, leading to a “slalom” manoeuvre to avoid it, or, if this was judged infeasible by the robot, a complete re-planning of the path to the goal.\n\nFinishing a spell as head of engineering science (1989–84), Brady was awarded an EPSRC Senior Fellowship, during which he spent two year-long periods in the INRIA Laboratory headed by Nicholas Ayache.  Brady had begun to switch from robotics to medical imaging, specifically breast cancer, in 1989, following the death of his mother-in-law Dr. Irene Friedlander from the disease.  For the past 29 years he has worked with Ralph Highnam, first supervising Ralph's thesis, then co-authoring a monograph Mammographic Image Analysis, then co-founding Mirada Solutions Ltd and subsequently Volpara Health Technologies (ASX: VHT).  Together, they developed an influential mathematical model of the fluence of X-rays through the female breast as a basis for analysis of mammographic images. This work was done in collaboration with Ralph Highnam and pioneered an entirely novel “physics-based” approach. This attracted the interest of Nico Karssemeijer and led to further collaborations and the company ScreenPoint bv co-founded by Mike and Nico.\nBrady is the ..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

W. Hudson Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJulia Linn Bell Hirschberg received her first Ph.D degree in History (16th-century Mexico) from University of Michigan in 1976. She served on the History faculty of Smith College from 1974 to 1982.  She subsequently shifted to Computer Science studies, receiving her M.S. in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1982 and a Ph.D in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1985.\nUpon graduation from University of Pennsylvania in 1985, Hirschberg joined AT&T Bell Labs as a Member of Technical staff in the Linguistics Research Department, where she worked on improving prosody assignment for Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) in the Bell Labs TTS system. She was promoted to Department Head in 1994 when she created a new Human Computer Interface Research Lab.  She and her department remained at Bell Labs until 1996 when they moved to AT&T Labs Research as part of a corporate reorganization.  In 2002, she joined the Columbia University faculty as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science. She served as Chair of the Computer Science Department from 2012 to 2018.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHirschberg's research has included prosody, discourse structure, spoken dialogue systems, speech search, and more recently analysis of deceptive speech. Hirschberg was among the first to combine Natural Language Processing  (NLP) approaches to discourse and dialogue with speech research.  She pioneered techniques in text analysis for prosody assignment in Text-to-Speech synthesis at Bell laboratories in the 1980s and 1990s,  developing corpus-based statistical models based upon syntactic and discourse information which are in general use today in TTS systems. With Janet Pierrehumbert, she developed a theoretical model of intonational meaning. She was a leader in the development of the ToBI conventions for intonational description, which have been extended to numerous languages and which today are the most widely used standard for intonational annotation.\nHirschberg has been a pioneer together with Gregory Ward in much experimental work on intonational sources of language meaning and how these interact with pragmatic phenomena, particularly on the meaning of accent (intonational prominent) items and the meaning of intonational contours. She also has innovated in numerous other areas involving prosody and meaning, including the role of grammatical function and surface position in pitch accent location,  the use of prosody in disambiguating cue phrases (discourse markers) with Diane Litman,  the role of prosody in disambiguation in English, Italian, and Spanish with Cinzia Avesani and Pilar Prieto,  and the automatic identification of speech recognition errors using prosodic information,  At AT&T Labs she worked with Fernando Pereira, Steve Whittaker, and others on speech search  and developing new interfaces for speech navigation.  At Columbia, she and her students have continued and extended research on spoken dialogue systems (automatically detecting speech..."

While earlier face recognition methods have focused on appearance - capturing, representing, and matching facial characteristics as they appear on 2D images in the visible spectrum, the proposed URxD system uses a webcam to capture a continuous video stream which is used to detect whether a person is facing the 3D camera, and if the subject is facing the camera relatively still for more than two seconds, the system triggers the optical scanner and the 3D data are captured. It can also determine whether the person is wearing glasses.

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

He obtained his bachelor's degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1987, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1991. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, he was with the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Laboratories. His research has included formal modeling and analysis of reactive systems, hybrid systems, model checking, software verification, design automation for embedded software, and program synthesis. He is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and has served as the chair of ACM SIGBED (Special Interest Group on Embedded Systems). He holds the title of Zisman Family Professor at UPenn since 2003.\n\nOver the past thirty years, Alur has introduced several novel models of computation that provide the theoretical foundations for analysis, design, synthesis, and verification of computer systems. While rooted in algorithms and logic, his research, with over 52,000 citations, has found applications in control theory, cyber-physical systems, multi-agent systems, and program synthesis. The specific contributions listed below are highlights of his high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science, for which he is recognized with the 2024 Knuth Prize.\nTimed Automata: Classical model checking was developed for the analysis of finite-state discrete systems. In a ground breaking paper in ICALP 1991, Alur and Dill introduced an extension of automata with continuous timers. They proposed an algorithm to analyze the resulting infinite-state systems by introducing a novel notion of time-abstract bisimulation for algorithmic construction of finite-state quotients. This framework of timed automata has become the standard formal model for real-time systems inspiring a lot of research in specification logics, verification algorithms, formal language theory, and control theory. Problems such as \"does a communication protocol deadlock?\" and \"synthesize the most general controller to maintain safety\", in the presence of timing constraints, can be formulated and solved using decision problems on timed automata. These algorithms have been implemented in many tools and applied to debugging real-world examples. Their work on timed automata is one of the most highly cited papers in theoretical computer science: the TCS’95 journal version has now over 10K citations. For this work, Alur and Dill were awarded the inaugural Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) award in 2008 and the inaugural Alonzo Church Award for outstanding contributions in logic and computation in 2016.\nReal-time Temporal Logics: A related line of research concerns extensions of temporal logics to specify real-time requirements. This work provides a foundational study of different variants based on the modalities used (branching time versus linear-time), the underlying semantics for time (dense versus discrete), and the primitives allowed in syntax for expressing timing constraints. In a sequence of papers, Alur and coauthors identified the syntactic and semantic restrictions necessary for decidability and developed optimal model-checking algorithms wheneve..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

She has one older sister, Rebecca. On 23 September 1995, Pascoe was accidentally run over by her father on the family ride-on lawnmower. As a result of the accident, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln.\nPascoe began swimming at the age of 7, and from the age of 8 up until 2022, was coached by Roly Crichton. She trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nPascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley.\nAt the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal.\nFollowing the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming. In February 2012, Pascoe became the inaugural winner of the Disabled Sportsperson of the Year award at the 2011 Halberg Awards.\nAt the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe competed in six events – the four in which she won medals at the 2008 Paralympics, plus the 50m freestyle (S10) and 100m freestyle (SM10) events. She successfully defended her 200 m individual medley (SM10) gold medal, breaking her own world record by four seconds with a time of 2:25.65.

She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln.\nPascoe began swimming at the age of 7, and from the age of 8 up until 2022, was coached by Roly Crichton. She trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nPascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley.\nAt the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal.\nFollowing the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming. In February 2012, Pascoe became the inaugural winner of the Disabled Sportsperson of the Year award at the 2011 Halberg Awards.\nAt the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe competed in six events – the four in which she won medals at the 2008 Paralympics, plus the 50m freestyle (S10) and 100m freestyle (SM10) events. She successfully defended her 200 m individual medley (SM10) gold medal, breaking her own world record by four seconds with a time of 2:25.65. She also won gold medals in the 100 m butterfly (S10), where she bettered her silver at Beijing and in the process setting a new world record with a time of 1:04.43, and in the 100 m freestyle (S10), setting a new Paralympic record with a time of 1:00.89. Pascoe won silver medals in the 50 m freestyle (S10), 100 m backstroke (S10), and 100 m breaststroke (SB9).\nIn March 2013, Pascoe broke her own world record for the 50m butterfly at the New Zealand Swimming Championships in Auckland, setting a time of 29.21 seconds.\nAt the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Pascoe competed in five events, dropping the 100 m breaststroke SB9. She won gold medals in the 100 m backstroke, 100 m butterfly and 200 m individual medley, the latter in world record time. She also won silver medals in the 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle, both behind Canada's Aurélie Rivard. Her 50 m freestyle medal holds the distinction as the 200th medal won by New Zealand..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute...

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books).

With collaborator Oliver Gassmann, he proposed a widely used behavioral model of evolution of global R&D organization based on internal organizational tension. He and Gassmann also formulated a supply-and-demand model for innovation globalization based external drivers, namely access to markets and access to technology. In managerial writings, he outlined support mechanisms appropriate to lead global innovation teams within such R&D organizations.\nEarly to study R&D in China, he co-developed theory of reverse innovation and innovation in emerging countries, both inbound R&D investments and management of innovation in China and outbound internationalization of R&D by Chinese firms. In this context, he refined organizational growth models for individual units as well as networks of units.

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

After completing his education at the University of Cambridge (BA, MMath, PhD), he spent the 1980s at Acorn Computers, where he was a principal designer of the BBC Micro and the ARM 32-bit RISC microprocessor. As of 2023, over 250 billion ARM chips have been manufactured, powering much of the world's mobile computing and embedded systems, everything from sensors to smartphones to servers.\nIn 1990, he moved to Manchester to lead research into asynchronous circuits, low-power electronics and neural engineering, where the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker) project is delivering a computer incorporating a million ARM processors optimised for computational neuroscience.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFurber was educated at Manchester Grammar School and represented the UK in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hungary in 1970 winning a bronze medal. He went on to study the Mathematical Tripos as an undergraduate student of St John's College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Mathematics (MMath – Part III of the Mathematical Tripos) degrees. In 1978, he was appointed a Rolls-Royce research fellow in aerodynamics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was awarded a PhD in 1980 for research on the fluid dynamics of the Weis-Fogh mechanism supervised by John Ffowcs Williams. During his PhD in the late 1970s, Furber worked on a voluntary basis for Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry within the fledging Acorn Computers (originally the Cambridge Processor Unit), on a number of projects; notably a microprocessor based fruit machine controller, and the Proton – the initial prototype version of what was to become the BBC Micro, in support of Acorn's tender for the BBC Computer Literacy Project.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nIn 1981, following the completion of his PhD and the award of the BBC contract to Acorn computers, Furber joined Acorn where he was a Hardware Designer and then Design Manager. He was involved in the final design and production of the BBC Micro and later, the Acorn Electron, and the ARM microprocessor. In August 1990 he moved to the University of Manchester to become the International Computers Limited (ICL) Professor of Computer Engineering and established the AMULET microprocessor research group.\nFurber's main research interests are in neural networks, networks on chip and microprocessors. In 2003, Furber was a member of the EPSRC research cluster in biologically inspired novel computation. On 16 September 2004, he gave a speech on Hardware Implementations of Large-scale Neural Networks as part of the initiation activities of the Alan Turing Institute.\nFurber's most recent project SpiNNaker, is an attempt to build a new kind of computer that directly mimics the workings of the human brain. Spinnaker is an artificial neural network realised in hardware, a massively parallel processing system eventually designed to incorporate a million ARM processors. The finished Spinnaker will model 1 per cent of the human brain's capability, or around 1 billion neurons.  The Spinnaker project aims amongst other things to investigate:\n\nHow can massively parallel computing resources accelerate our understanding of brain function?\nHow can our growing understanding of brain function point the w..."

He is the director of the Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).\n\n\n== Life ==\nAndreas Engel studied medicine and philosophy at Saarland University, Homburg, at the Technical University of Munich, and at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. After his medical exams (German Staatsexamen), he received his Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) from the Technical University Munich in 1987. \nIn 1987–1995 Engel was a post-doctoral fellow with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, Frankfurt, Germany. From 1996-2000, Engel headed a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research which was funded by the Heisenberg Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Between fall 1997 and summer 1998, he also was affiliated as a Daimler-Benz Fellow to the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. \nFrom 2000-2002, he worked at the Jülich Research Centre as head of the Cellular Neurobiology Group at the Institute for Medicine. In 2002, he was appointed to the Chair of Neurophysiology at the UKE. Engel is a member of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Hamburg. Since 2011, he is the coordinator of Collaborative Research Centre SFB 936 \"Multi-Site Communication in the Brain\" (with C. Gerloff, Dept. of Neurology, UKE).\n\n\n== Research ==\nAndreas Engel has become known by his work on the so-called \"binding problem\". His research focuses on the hypothesis that temporal synchrony serves for dynamic coordination of signals in the brain. In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications.\nAs a postdoctoral researcher with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.\nIn addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling.\nIn the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing, attention, working memory, decision-making and consciousness.\nRecent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration. The group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation. \nEngel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action. A major focus of his work are the implications of the studies on neural synchrony for un..."

He obtained his bachelor's degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1987, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1991. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, he was with the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Laboratories. His research has included formal modeling and analysis of reactive systems, hybrid systems, model checking, software verification, design automation for embedded software, and program synthesis. He is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and has served as the chair of ACM SIGBED (Special Interest Group on Embedded Systems). He holds the title of Zisman Family Professor at UPenn since 2003.\n\nOver the past thirty years, Alur has introduced several novel models of computation that provide the theoretical foundations for analysis, design, synthesis, and verification of computer systems. While rooted in algorithms and logic, his research, with over 52,000 citations, has found applications in control theory, cyber-physical systems, multi-agent systems, and program synthesis. The specific contributions listed below are highlights of his high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science, for which he is recognized with the 2024 Knuth Prize.\nTimed Automata: Classical model checking was developed for the analysis of finite-state discrete systems. In a ground breaking paper in ICALP 1991, Alur and Dill introduced an extension of automata with continuous timers. They proposed an algorithm to analyze the resulting infinite-state systems by introducing a novel notion of time-abstract bisimulation for algorithmic construction of finite-state quotients. This framework of timed automata has become the standard formal model for real-time systems inspiring a lot of research in specification logics, verification algorithms, formal language theory, and control theory. Problems such as \"does a communication protocol deadlock?\" and \"synthesize the most general controller to maintain safety\", in the presence of timing constraints, can be formulated and solved using decision problems on timed automata. These algorithms have been implemented in many tools and applied to debugging real-world examples. Their work on timed automata is one of the most highly cited papers in theoretical computer science: the TCS’95 journal version has now over 10K citations. For this work, Alur and Dill were awarded the inaugural Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) award in 2008 and the inaugural Alonzo Church Award for outstanding contributions in logic and computation in 2016.\nReal-time Temporal Logics: A related line of research concerns extensions of temporal logics to specify real-time requirements. This work provides a foundational study of different variants based on the modalities used (branching time versus linear-time), the underlying semantics for time (dense versus discrete), and the primitives allowed in syntax for expressing timing constraints. In a sequence of papers, Alur and coauthors identified the syntactic and semantic restrictions necessary for decidability and developed optimal model-checking algorithms wheneve..."

He received his doctorate in physics in 1990 at the Ural Division of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in his hometown of Ekaterinburg.\nAfter two years of research at the University of Manitoba, he returned to graduate school at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and received his Ph.D in applied mathematics, a program that combined math and biology. His current work is in computational biology, which combines chemistry, biology, math and physics.\n\n\n== Research and Innovations ==\nOne of Mogilner's research topics is the mitotic spindle and how it is assembled. The mitotic spindle is what pulls conjoined chromosomes apart during cell division.\nMogilner hypothesized that the chromosomes were surrounded by proteins that directed the microtubules toward them. A few years after, research in Germany confirmed his prediction. His key papers on the subject have been cited hundreds of times; the most cited one, in Biophysical Journal has been cited 614 times by October 2014.\nHe is an Associate Editor at the Journal of Cell Biology and Bulletin of Mathematical Biology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1]\nChoi, Colin K.; Vicente-Manzanares, Miguel; Zareno, Jessica; Whitmore, Leanna A.; Mogilner, Alex; Horwitz, Alan Rick (2008). \"Actin and α-actinin orchestrate the assembly and maturation of nascent adhesions in a myosin II motor-independent manner\".

Initially the project had defined four goals:\n\nprovides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,\ndefines the meaning of each term (aka semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as possible\nimplements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable TOVE to automatically deduce the answer to many \"common sense\" questions about the enterprise, and\ndefines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical context.\nThe TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering.\n\n\n=== Enterprise modeling ===\nIn the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Grüninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating:\n\nIn enterprise modelling, we want to define the actions performed within an enterprise, and define constraints for plans and schedules which are constructed to satisfy the goals of the enterprise.

It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (s, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (c, = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (Φ, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (w). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\", for example   \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for   S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            \n                              |\n                            \n                            \n                              \n                                |\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    NCS 1950\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Standard\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n    ...

She has also represented New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Christchurch on 8 January 1993 to Garry and Jo Pascoe, Sophie grew up on a lifestyle block near Halswell on the south-western outskirts of the city. She has one older sister, Rebecca. On 23 September 1995, Pascoe was accidentally run over by her father on the family ride-on lawnmower. As a result of the accident, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln.\nPascoe began swimming at the age of 7, and from the age of 8 up until 2022, was coached by Roly Crichton. She trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nPascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley.\nAt the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal.\nFollowing the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming.

He was with Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, Colorado, for almost 21 years, where he is a Professor Emeritus. He was elevated to Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  for applications of artificial intelligence in control of power electronics systems.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSimões was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 1963, to José L.G. Simões and Cecília A.B.G. Simões, with a sister, Maysa A.G. Simões. When he was 11 years old, he had a strong motivation and decided to become an electrical engineer when his cousin, Hélio Adauto de Paula, showed him vacuum tube radios, transistorized audio amplifiers, and took Simões to visit his work as an electrical machine designer in Equacional, a motor manufacturing company in the city of São Paulo.\nSimões was enrolled in an evening Catholic high school from 1978 to 1980, \"Liceu Coração de Jesus\", where he learned electronics as part of a technician degree. At that time, there was a job market for electronic technicians in Brazil, but he wanted to study further, and become an engineer. Therefore, in 1980, Simões took the entrance exams (FUVEST) for the University of São Paulo (USP) and was admitted as a student in \"Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (EPUSP)\". He completed his B.Sc. degree in 1985. In 1982 he was admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of EPUSP and started an internship at FDTE - Fundação para o Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Engenharia. From 1984 to 1985, he focused his expertise in telecommunications, antennas, high frequency, analog, and digital circuits design. His Senior Design in 1985 was a modem with analog and digital circuits implemented for interfacing an 8085 microprocessor, operating on a regular telephone connection. Such a system was made before the age of computers connected on telephone lines via modems. During his four years internship for FDTE, he was learning with senior engineers how to design DC-DC converters and off-line switching mode power supplies, using Phillips manuals for TV flyback circuits and National Instruments handbooks. Those power converters were built and implemented in railroad automation (FEPASA), as well as in the São Paulo Metro subway system. In 1985 Simões graduated from EPUSP and worked as an engineer for a few years with FDTE. He was inspired by several faculty from EPUSP, for example, Prof. Luiz de Queiroz Orsini who taught him modern computer-based electrical and electronics circuits analysis (that time with mainframes, and later on MAC's and PC's), José Roberto Cardoso who taught electrical machines and energy conversion. Simões also learned a lot from Prof. Edson Benedicto Ramos Féris and Prof. Guido Stolfi techniques for analog high-frequency circuit designer. During the Senior year (1985) Simões attended a course from Prof. Waldir Pó on introduction to Power Electronics, where the principles of utilizing thyristors, diodes, and transistors, to control electrical circuits for energy conversion was a transformation in how Simões wanted to further his career, giving him a strong motivation to learn and understand power electronics for controlling machines, ac-dc, dc-ac, and dc-dc power conversion.\nFrom 1986 to 1989, Simões worked for FDTE, at the same time leading technical research with three other partners wh..."

Boyd is an American professor and control theorist. He is the Samsung Professor of Engineering, Professor in Electrical Engineering, and professor by courtesy in Computer Science and Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University. He is also affiliated with Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME).\nIn 2014, Boyd was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to engineering design and analysis via convex optimization.\n\n\n== Academic biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nBoyd received an AB degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Harvard University in 1980, and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 under the supervision of Charles A. Desoer, S. Shankar Sastry and Leon Ong Chua. While at Berkeley, he was awarded a Hertz Fellowship (1982) and received the Hertz Thesis Prize (1985). In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, and in 2017, from the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nBoyd joined the faculty of Stanford University's Electrical Engineering department in 1985. He regularly teaches undergraduate courses in applied linear algebra and machine learning. During his time at Stanford, he has been recognized with several teaching awards, including the 2016 Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the school's highest teaching honor. He was awarded the 2017 IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal, in recognition of his efforts in education in the theory and application of optimization, which has sparked the writing of improved linear algebra and convex optimization textbooks. He has served as director of Stanford's Information Systems Laboratory, and as a visiting professor at universities including City University of Hong Kong, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. While at Stanford, he has consulted with numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, and founded one. His groups' CVXGEN software is used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to guide their autonomous precision landing.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nBoyd's primary research interests are convex optimization, especially applications in control, signal processing, machine learning, and finance. His PhD dissertation was on Volterra series descriptions of nonlinear circuits and devices. His primary focus then turned to automatic control systems, where he focused on applying convex optimization, specifically linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), to a variety of control system analysis and synthesis problems.\nWith Craig Barratt, he authored Linear Controller Design: Limits of Performance in 1991. In 1994, Boyd and Laurent El Ghaoui, Eric Feron, and Ragu Balakrishnan authored the book Linear Matrix Inequalities in System & Control Theory. Around 1999, he and Lieven Vandenberghe developed a PhD-level course and wrote the book Convex Optimization to introduce and apply convex optimization to other fields.\nIn 2005 he and Michael Grant developed the MATLAB open source software package CVX, which makes it easy to specify and solve convex optimization problems. This work earned them the 2012 Beale-Orchard-Hays Prize for Excellence in Computational Mathematical Programming. In 2012 he and Jacob Mattingley developed CVXGEN, which generates fast custo..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He is the director of the Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).\n\n\n== Life ==\nAndreas Engel studied medicine and philosophy at Saarland University, Homburg, at the Technical University of Munich, and at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. After his medical exams (German Staatsexamen), he received his Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) from the Technical University Munich in 1987. \nIn 1987–1995 Engel was a post-doctoral fellow with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, Frankfurt, Germany. From 1996-2000, Engel headed a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research which was funded by the Heisenberg Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Between fall 1997 and summer 1998, he also was affiliated as a Daimler-Benz Fellow to the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. \nFrom 2000-2002, he worked at the Jülich Research Centre as head of the Cellular Neurobiology Group at the Institute for Medicine. In 2002, he was appointed to the Chair of Neurophysiology at the UKE. Engel is a member of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Hamburg. Since 2011, he is the coordinator of Collaborative Research Centre SFB 936 \"Multi-Site Communication in the Brain\" (with C. Gerloff, Dept. of Neurology, UKE).\n\n\n== Research ==\nAndreas Engel has become known by his work on the so-called \"binding problem\". His research focuses on the hypothesis that temporal synchrony serves for dynamic coordination of signals in the brain. In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications.\nAs a postdoctoral researcher with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.\nIn addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling.\nIn the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing, attention, working memory, decision-making and consciousness.\nRecent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration. The group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation. \nEngel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action. A major focus of his work are the implications of the studies on neural synchrony for un..."

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory.\nLasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\"\nHer specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIrena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nAfter receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of.\n\n\n== Areas of Study in Applied Mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Optimization ===\nOptimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions.\nThe work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations.\n\n\n=== Control theory ===\nControl Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\"\nIn simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal..."

He is also an entrepreneur, a professor emeritus with the University of California, Davis, founder of the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), and former president, CEO, and chief scientist of this firm for 25 years (1986 to 2011) prior to sale of its IP to Lockheed Martin.\nGardner has authored four advanced-level engineering books on statistical signal processing theory including Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Nonprobabilistic Theory, 1987, which has been cited over 1200 times in peer-reviewed journal articles. Gardner's approach in this book is considered to be in keeping with the work of Norbert Wiener in his classic treatise Generalized Harmonic Analysis first published in 1930.\nIn the literature, Gardner is referred to as an influential pioneer of cyclostationarity theory and methodology, on the basis of his being a contributor of seminal advances. Gardner has written more than 100 peer-reviewed original-research articles. His research papers and books have been cited in seventeen thousand peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGardner married Nancy Susan Lenhart in June 1966 and the following year completed his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology while employed as a member of technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1967 to 1969, and completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Massachusetts under the supervision of Lewis E. Franks in 1972, at which time he joined the University of California, Davis as an Assistant Professor.\nGardner performed research and teaching there for nearly 30 years, becoming Professor Emeritus in 2001 and returning as Research Professor in 2023. In 1982, while at University of California, Gardner founded the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), an engineering research services company working primarily with the national security sector but also the cellular RF communications industry. He served as the president, CEO, and chief scientist of SSPI for 25 years. He also founded several entrepreneurial ventures during the latter 15 years of that period, including Gardner Technologies in 2001 for which he served as IP inventor and chief technology officer for five years.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAfter completing his Ph.D. dissertation entitled \"Representation and Estimation of Cyclostationary Processes,\" in 1972, Gardner began working on developing a new theory for the class of cyclostationary and polycyclostationary random processes.\nIn 1985, he wrote his first book, Introduction to Random Processes with Applications to Signals and Systems, which focused on the duality between the stochastic theory based on mathematical expectation and the nonstochastic (non-population) theory based on time averaging, which theory he was developing. Amir Atiya wrote \"The book is an excellent introduction to the theory of random processes... I recommend everyone working in the areas of signal processing and communications to own a copy.\" Lawrence Marple wrote \"The depth of coverage and the ease of readability can be compared to classic texts such as [A Papoulis's book which emphasizes theory and J Bend..."

As the political conflict in Argentina increased, Dahl attended graduate school in  France. In 1977, she was the first graduate at the Université d'Aix-Marseille to receive a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile involved in the research for her doctorate, Dahl became a pioneer in the field of logic programming, developing both the first logic programming database system, and an (also logic-programmed) front end to consult it in a human language (Spanish). Dahl's research and methodologies became multi-disciplinary including Computational Linguistics, Computational Molecular Biology, and Artificial Intelligence. She became an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1991. In 1996 she was honoured by the Logic Programming Association as one of the 15 founders of the Logic Programming Field, and has extensively pioneered as well the areas of Logic Grammars and Constraint Handling Rules.\nDahl is a woman pioneer in a male-dominated field. She fought gender inequality while she was a professor at Simon Fraser University, both through mentoring and role modelling, and through concrete actions. After Simon Fraser University refused to reimburse her $17 for childcare expenses while she was delivering a guest speech in Victoria, where she’d traveled with her nursing baby, she went first to her department and then Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) with her protest, which ended with the NSERC changing their policy to make childcare a covered expense for nursing researchers they funded. She proposed and actively promoted the provision of childcare at logic programming conferences, until it was adopted formally into their constitution, and is now routinely offered as a result. She also obtained a change in SFU's legislation when it resulted in her graduate student being timed out for delays caused by life-threatening medical conditions upon birthing twins.\nShe has developed numerous international research projects and collaborations, most notably with Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France, and worked with IBM, Vancouver Software Labs, International Artificial Intelligence. In her work with IBM, she obtained a record-breaking research contract. She served as president of the Association of Logic Programming from 2001-2005. She was awarded the prestigious Marie Curie Chair of Excellence 2008-2011 from the European Commission for her pioneering work on Constraint Solving and Language Processing for Bioinformatics. In 2012 she quit her Full Professor position at Simon Fraser University in order to focus on research. SFU awarded her Lifetime Professor Emerits status as from 2013.  Her research program continues under NSERC funding, as well as through her own AI company, Regenerative AI, and she serves at the Scientific Advisory Board of IMDEA Software. She balances her scientific activities with artistic ones, as a student of music, theatre and dance, and performs regularly as singer and guitarist in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Research ==\nDahl's research is focused on \"bridging the gap between the formal and the humanistic sciences, and to achieve more human-like communication with c..."

His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled “Multiprocessor Systems with Process Communication” where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur.\nHis paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes.\nBased on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in.\nHe published many other papers on queuing network models.

Practically at the midpoint of the Iberian Peninsula's Atlantic coast, it is located at the mouth of the Mondego River, 40 km (25 mi) west of Coimbra and sheltered by hills (Serra da Boa Viagem), sharing about the same latitude with Philadelphia, Baku and Beijing. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 62,125, in an area of 379.05 km2 (146.35 sq mi). The city of Figueira da Foz proper has a population of 46,600. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.\nIt is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a tourism city, it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest casinos of the Iberian Peninsula – the Casino Figueira.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the legend, the place's name is due to a fig tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. Foz means \"place of discharge\", often used at the point a river meets another body of water, specially where there is a clear energy or water flow clash. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the Neolithic age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this, an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. Julião, to the cathedral Sé Velha of Coimbra.\nKnowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role in the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the shipbuilding and cod drying industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to vila (small town) on 12 March 1771 and turned city (cidade) on 20 September 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained a great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Portuguese nickname of Rainha das Praias (Queen of the Beaches).\nThe municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of Buarcos, the Serra da Boa Viagem – a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside promenade paved with typical Portuguese pavement. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with the archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the Santa Catarina Fort and the old Buarcos Fortress, the Relógio Tower by the main sandy beach, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of Abadias.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Navigator, formerly and still commonly known as Soporcel, and Celbi, part of Altri) and glass (Verallia, part of Saint-Gobain). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries. Until the turn of the 21st century, a factory of the CIMPOR Group was installed in the Mondeg..."

He has worked in both the United States and Australia, and is currently based at the University of Bristol, UK, where he is the chair of cognitive psychology at the School of Psychological Science. His research, which originally pertained to computer simulations of people's decision-making processes, recently has focused on the public's understanding of science and why people often embrace beliefs that are sharply at odds with scientific evidence.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nLewandowsky received his bachelor's degree from Washington College in 1980, followed by an M.A. in 1981 and a PhD in 1985, both from the University of Toronto. He served as an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1994, and as associate professor for one year after that. In 1995, he joined the University of Western Australia, where he became the Winthrop Professor of Psychology in 2000. He remained there until April 2013, when he joined the University of Bristol. In 2014, he was named the first Digital Content Editor at the Psychonomic Society.\nIn 2015, Lewandowsky was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Correction of misinformation ===\nLewandowsky has published a number of studies examining people's belief in misinformation. In 2005, he was the lead author of a study which investigated people's beliefs in assertions about the Iraq War that had been retracted officially, and which examined people's beliefs about these assertions in Australia, the United States, and Germany. He and his co-authors found that American participants in the study persisted in believing the assertions even after being informed that they had been retracted. Lewandowsky told the Wall Street Journal that the original misinformation already had become a part of the Americans' mental worldview by the time it was retracted. He also noted that \"People who were not suspicious of the motives behind the war continued to rely on misinformation.\" In 2012, Lewandowsky published an article in Psychological Science in the Public Interest which examined the literature on misinformation and efforts to correct it. He found a considerable amount of speculation but little concrete research into the area.\nWith John Cook, Lewandowsky wrote \"The Debunking Handbook\", a review of research on debunking falsehoods and a guide to better practices for doing so. Much of \"The Debunking Handbook\" focuses on \"backfire effects\", whereby telling people that they are wrong often reinforces their prior beliefs, rather than weakening them. An updated Debunking Handbook 2020 tries to represent the consensus of the field.\n\n\n=== Climate change and conspiracy theories ===\nIn 2012, Lewandowsky put forward what would later become one of his best-known studies regarding public opinion on climate change. The survey examined data from more than 1,000 readers of climate science blogs, taken from online questionnaires posted there. Lewandowsky approached five climate sceptic blogs to ask them to post the questionnaire, but they all declined to do so. The study was accepted by Psychological Science on 7 July 2012, and published in the May 2013 issue of the journal with the title, \"NASA Faked the Moon Landing—Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\". Based on a survey of visitors to global warming related blogs, Lewandowsky and his two co-authors concluded that belief in free-market econom..."

Menczer is the Director of the Observatory on Social Media, a research center where data scientists and journalists study the role of media and technology in society and build tools to analyze and counter disinformation and manipulation on social media. Menczer holds courtesy appointments in Cognitive Science and Physics, is a founding member and advisory council member of the IU Network Science Institute, a former director the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, a senior research fellow of the Kinsey Institute, a fellow of the Center for Computer-Mediated Communication, and a former fellow of the Institute for Scientific Interchange in Turin, Italy. In 2020 he was named a Fellow of the ACM.\n\n\n== Education, career, service ==\nMenczer holds a Laurea in physics from the Sapienza University of Rome and a PhD in computer science and cognitive science from the University of California, San Diego. He used to be an assistant professor of management sciences at the University of Iowa, and a fellow-at-large of the Santa Fe Institute. At Indiana University Bloomington since 2003, he served as division chair in the Luddy School in 2009–2011. Menczer has been the recipient of Fulbright, Rotary Foundation, and NATO fellowships, and a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation. He holds editorial positions for the journals Network Science, EPJ Data Science, PeerJ Computer Science, and HKS Misinformation Review. He has served as program or track chair for various conferences including The Web Conference and the ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media. He was general chair of the ACM Web Science 2014 Conference and general co-chair of the NetSci 2017 Conference.\n\n\n== Research ==\nMenczer's research focuses on Web science, social networks, social media, social computation, Web mining, data science, distributed and intelligent Web applications, and modeling of complex information networks. He introduced the idea of topical and adaptive Web crawlers, a specialized and intelligent type of Web crawler.\nMenczer is also known for his work on social phishing, a type of phishing attacks that leverage friendship information from social networks, yielding over 70% success rate in experiments (with Markus Jakobsson); semantic similarity measures for information and social networks; models of complex information and social networks (with Alessandro Vespignani and others); search engine censorship; and search engine bias.\nThe group led by Menczer has analyzed and modeled how memes, information, and misinformation spread through social media in domains such as the Occupy movement, the Gezi Park protests, and political elections. Data and tools from Menczer's lab have aided in finding the roots of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the disinformation campaign targeting the White Helmets, and in taking down voter-suppression bots on Twitter. Menczer and coauthors have also found a link between online COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy.\nAnalysis by Menczer's team demonstrated the echo-chamber structure of information-diffusion networks on Twitter during the 2010 United States elections. The team found that conservatives almost exclusively retweeted other conservatives while l..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

He was Professor at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGottlob obtained his undergraduate and PhD degrees in computer science at Vienna University of Technology in 1981.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nGottlob is currently a chaired professor at the University of Calabria in Italy where he joined in 2023 due to the \"Fantastic Équipe and great potential\" that he belivies there is in this University. He was a professor of computing science at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science, where he helped establish the information systems research group. He is also a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford. Previously, he was a professor of computer science at Vienna University of Technology, where he still maintains an adjunct position. He was elected a member of the Royal Society in May 2010. He is a founding member of the Oxford-Man Institute.\nHe has published more than 250 scientific articles in the areas of computational logic, database theory, and artificial intelligence, and one textbook on logic programming and databases.\nIn the area of artificial intelligence, he is best known for his influential early work on the complexity of nonmonotonic logics and on (generalised) hypertree decompositions, a framework for obtaining tractable structural classes of constraint satisfaction problems, and a generalisation of the notion of tree decomposition from graph theory. This work has also had substantial impact in database theory, since it is known that the problem of evaluating conjunctive queries on relational databases is equivalent to the constraint satisfaction problem. His recent work on XML query languages (notably XPath) has helped create the complexity-theoretical foundations of this area.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nGottlob has received numerous awards and honours including election to the Royal Society in 2010.  His nomination for the Royal Society reads: Georg Gottlob has made fundamental contributions to both artificial intelligence and to database systems. His research has centred on the algorithmic and logical aspects of knowledge representation, database queries, and recently for web data processing. His work has resulted in the invention of several efficient algorithms for constraint satisfaction, web data extraction and database query processing, some of which are now in widespread use. He has developed a common core to the underlying principles of artificial intelligence and databases. In his work on clarifying the intrinsic complexity of problems in these areas, Gottlob has solved open problems in computational logic, non-monotonic reasoning and database theory.\nGottlob has also been designated as an ECCAI fellow [1] in 2002, and received honorary doctorates from the University of Klagenfurt (2016) and the University of Vienna (2020).\n\n\n== References ==..."

Brown School of Engineering, a professor of Computer Science and a professor of BioSciences at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNakhleh was born on May 8, 1974, to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds both U.S. and Israeli citizenship.\nNakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. Tandy Warnow, in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, and became a Full Professor in 2016.  He served as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science from July 2018 until December 2020. Nakhleh served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Rice University from 2017 to 2020.\nIn addition to his duties as the Dean of Engineering at Rice University, Nakhleh currently teaches courses in discrete mathematics and computational biology. Nakhleh has received high acclaim at Rice University for his skills in teaching, and he is the recipient of many awards in this area.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nNakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and comparative genomics under \nscenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious phylogenetic networks: networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to reticulate evolution. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) \nevolutionary history of the Indo-European languages. Their paper on perfect phylogenetic networks was included as one of the 20 best papers published in Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America, in the 30-year period 1986–2016.\nLater, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably incomplete lineage sorting. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies coalescent with gene flow.\nAdditionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics.\nNakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet, an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nNakhleh's honors and awards include:\n\nThe National Science Foundation CAREER Award, 2009.\nThe Sloan Fellowship in the Molecular Biology category, 2010.\nThe Guggenheim Fellowship in the Organismic Biology and Ecology category, 2012.\n\n\n== References ==..."

Sutton  is a Canadian computer scientist. He is a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta and a research scientist at Keen Technologies. \nSutton is considered one of the founders of modern computational reinforcement learning, having several significant contributions to the field, including temporal difference learning and policy gradient methods.\n\n\n== Life and education ==\nRichard Sutton was born in Ohio, and grew up in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.\nSutton received his B.A. in psychology from Stanford University in 1978 before taking an M.S. (1980) and Ph.D. (1984) in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Andrew Barto. His doctoral dissertation, Temporal Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning, introduced actor-critic architectures and temporal credit assignment.\nHe was influenced by Harry Klopf's work in the 1970s, which proposed that supervised learning is insufficient for AI or explaining intelligent behavior, and trial-and-error learning, driven by \"hedonic aspects of behavior\", is necessary. This focussed his interest to reinforcement learning.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1984, Sutton was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts.\nFrom 1985 to 1994, he was a principal member of technical staff in the Computer and Intelligent Systems Laboratory at GTE in Waltham, Massachusetts. After that, he spent 3 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a senior research scientist.\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Sutton worked at the AT&T Shannon Laboratory in Florham Park, New Jersey as principal technical staff member in the artificial intelligence department.\nSince 2003, he has been a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta. He led the institution's Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory until 2018.\nWhile retaining his professorship, Sutton joined Deepmind in June 2017 as a distinguished research scientist and co-founder of its Edmonton office.\nSutton became a Canadian citizen in 2015 and renounced his US citizenship in 2017.\nIn a 2019 essay, Sutton criticized the field of AI research for failing \"to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run\", arguing that \"70 years of AI research [had shown] that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin\", beating efforts building on human knowledge about specific fields like computer vision, speech recognition, chess or Go.\nIn 2023 he and John Carmack announced a partnership for the development of AGI.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nSutton, R.

His PhD thesis (1984) was entitled “Multiprocessor Systems with Process Communication” where he developed queuing network models to analyze the performance of the multiprocessor systems which were important subject in the early 1980s. In particular, he developed queueing network models for process communication where the buffers were finite and blocking/losses of messages could occur.\nHis paper  was the first which was an original work introducing the duality of the state spaces of queueing networks with blocking/finite buffers versus queueing networks without blocking kind of mapping of state space to each other, and accordingly obtaining exact product form solution for two nodes.\nBased on this novel duality concept, Dr. Akyildiz showed in  an approximate duality (mapping) of state spaces between queuing networks with and without blocking having arbitrary number of nodes. He then derived the approximate throughput formula and also derived approximate product form solutions in.\nHe published many other papers on queuing network models. These contributions lead him to obtain the IEEE Fellow rank in 1996, and in particular  to performance analysis of computer communication networks.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n\n==== ATM and Wireless ATM Networks ====\nIn 1997 Ian Akyildiz with his colleagues at the YURIE  systems designed and implemented the first adaptive for..."

Between 2000 and 2002 he was a research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center.  In 2002, he joined the department of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign as an assistant professor.  He became an associate professor in 2008 and a full professor in 2014.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIEEE/ACM most influential paper of the International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) award in 2016 (for an ASE 2001 paper)\nRuntime Verification (RV) test of time award (for an RV 2001 paper)\nACM distinguished paper awards at ASE 2008, ASE 2016, and OOPSLA 2016\nBest software science paper award at ETAPS 2002\nNSF CAREER award in 2005\nAd AStra award in 2016\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nRoșu coined the term \"runtime verification\" together with Havelund\nas the name of a workshop\nstarted in 2001, aiming at addressing problems at the boundary between formal verification and testing.  \nRoșu and his collaborators \nintroduced algorithms and techniques for \nparametric property monitoring,\nefficient monitor synthesis, \nruntime predictive analysis,\nand monitoring-oriented programming.\nRoșu also founded Runtime Verification, Inc.,\na company aimed at commercializing runtime verification technology.\nRoșu created and led the design and development of the K framework, which is an executable \nsemantic framework where programming languages, \ntype systems, and formal analysis tools are defined using configurations, computations, and rewrite rules.  \nLanguage tools such as interpreters, \nvirtual machines, compilers, symbolic execution and formal verification tools, are automatically or semi-automatically generated by the K framework. \nFormal semantics of several known programming languages, such as C,\nJava,\nJavaScript,\nPython,\nand Ethereum Virtual Machine\nare defined using the K framework.\nRoșu introduced matching logic\nas a foundation for the K framework and for programming languages, \nspecification, and verification. It is as expressive as first-order logic plus mathematical induction, \nand uses a compact notation to capture, as syntactic sugar, several formal systems of critical importance, such as algebraic specification and initial algebra semantics, first-order logic with least fixed points,\ntyped or untyped lambda-calculi, \ndependent type systems, \n separation logic with recursive predicates, rewriting logic,\nHoare logic, temporal logics, \ndynamic logic, and the modal μ-calculus.\nRoșu's Ph.D. thesis proposed circular coinduction\nas an automation of coinduction in the context of hidden logic.  This was further generalized into a principle that unifies and automates proofs by both induction and coinduction, and has been implemented\nin Coq,\nIsabelle/HOL,\nDafny,\nand as part of the CIRC theorem prover.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nLinkedIn\nPublications (Google, DBLP)..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

He is the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBen Green was born on 27 February 1977 in Bristol, England. He studied at local schools in Bristol, Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School, competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1994 and 1995. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995 and completed his BA in mathematics in 1998, winning the Senior Wrangler title. He stayed on for Part III and earned his doctorate under the supervision of Timothy Gowers, with a thesis entitled Topics in arithmetic combinatorics (2003). During his PhD he spent a year as a visiting student at Princeton University. He was a research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge between 2001 and 2005, before becoming a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bristol from January 2005 to September 2006 and then the first Herchel Smith Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge from September 2006 to August 2013. He became the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford on 1 August 2013. He was also a Research Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and held various positions at institutes such as Princeton University, University of British Columbia, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nThe majority of Green's research is in the fields of analytic number theory and additive combinatorics, but he also has results in harmonic analysis and in group theory. His best known theorem, proved jointly with his frequent collaborator Terence Tao, states that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers: this is now known as the Green–Tao theorem.\nAmongst Green's early results in additive combinatorics are an improvement of a result of Jean Bourgain of the size of arithmetic progressions in sumsets, as well as a proof of the Cameron–Erdős conjecture on sum-free sets of natural numbers. He also proved an arithmetic regularity lemma for functions defined on the first \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n natural numbers, somewhat analogous to the Szemerédi regularity lemma for graphs.\nFrom 2004–2010, in joint work with Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler, he developed so-called higher order Fourier analysis. This theory relates Gowers norms with objects known as nilsequences. The theory derives its name from these nilsequences, which play an analogous role to the role that characters play in classical Fourier analysis. Green and Tao used higher order Fourier analysis to present a new method for counting the number of solutions to simultaneous equations in certain sets of integers, including in the primes. This generalises the classical approach using Hardy–Littlewood circle method. Many aspects of this theory, including the quantitative aspects of the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms, are still the subject of ongoing research.\nGreen has also collaborated with Emmanuel Breuillard on topics in group theory. In particular, jointly with Terence Tao, they proved a structure theorem for approximate groups, generalising the Freiman-Ruzsa theorem on sets of integers with small doubling. Green also has worked, jointly with Kevin Ford and Sean Eberhard, on the theory of the symmetric group, in particular on what proportion of its elements fix a set o..."

He wrote as Andrew J. Offutt, A. J. Offutt, and Andy Offutt. His normal byline, andrew j. offutt, has all his name in lower-case letters. His erotica appeared under seventeen different pseudonyms, principally John Cleve, John Denis, Jeff Morehead, and Turk Winter.\n\nThe Sword of Skelos (1979), one of Offutt's contributions to the Conan The Barbarian saga, included a short, facetious biographical note: \"Andrew J. Offutt is the recently 'tired and re-tired', as he puts it, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He loves heroic fantasy though at 6' 1\" he is built for speed, not combat. Kentuckian  Offutt has a number of other books in and out of print, and has been a helpless fan of Robert E. Howard since birth. Now he calls himself the Steve Garvey among writers; 'Surely it's every boy's dream to grow up—but not too much—and get to write about Conan'. Offutt researches with gusto, both in and out of books, having—briefly and painfully, he says—worn chainmail and helm and wielded sword. He is also tired of aged, bald, ugly, sexless mages and squeaky females in heroic fantasy\".\n\n\n== Life and family ==\nOffutt was born in a log cabin near Taylorsville, Kentucky. He was married for more than 50 years to Jodie McCabe Offutt of Lexington, Kentucky. They had four children: writer Chris Offutt; Jeff Offutt, Professor of Software Engineering at George Mason University; Scotty Hyde, copy editor for the Park City Daily News in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Melissa Offutt, a sales executive for Sprint in San Diego. Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.\n\n\n== Career in speculative fiction ==\n\nOffutt began publishing in 1954 with the story \"And Gone Tomorrow\" in the If.  Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story \"Blacksword\" to Galaxy in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it \"embarrassingly amateur\".\nOffutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the \"Thieves World\" series edited by Robert Asprin and Lynn Abbey, which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as Shadowspawn (and, later, Chance).  His \"Iron Lords\" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by Robert E. Howard. There was a series on Howard's best known character, Conan, and another one on the less known Cormac mac Art—an Irish Viking active in King Arthur's time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.\nAs \"John Cleve\", Offutt also wrote the 19-book erotic science fiction series \"Spaceways\", over half of which were collaborations.\nAs an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled Swords Against Darkness, which included the first professional sale by Charles de Lint. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA).\n\n\n== Career in erotica ==\nOffutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, \"Anonymous,\" Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P.

He has been a Fellow of Keble College, Oxford, since 1985 and was elected a foreign associate member of the French Academy of Sciences in 2015. He was formerly BP Professor of Information Engineering at Oxford from 1985 to 2010 and a senior research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 1980 to 1985.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBrady was educated in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, where he was awarded a first class Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1966 followed by a Master of Science degree in 1968. He went on to study at the Australian National University, where he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1970 for research into group theory supervised by László György Kovács.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nBrady is an authority in the field of image analysis, initially working on shape analysis while at MIT, then on robotics, but most of all with an emphasis on medical image analysis. At MIT he worked on: the multiscale representation of the bounding contours of shapes (the curvature primal sketch), with Haruo Asada (Toshiba); two dimensional shapes (smoothed local symmetries), with Jon Connell; and the application of differential geometry to three-dimensional data, with Jean Ponce and Demetri Terzopoulos. He also worked on texture with Alan Yuille. He also worked with John M. Hollerbach, Tomàs Lozano-Pérez, and Matt Mason on robotics, who together published an early influential collection of articles and founded a seminal series of conferences.\nArriving in Oxford in 1985, he established the Robotics Laboratory and recruited Andrew Blake, Andrew Zisserman, Stephen Cameron, Hugh Durrant-Whyte, Lionel Tarassenko, Alison Noble, and David Murray. His initial focus was on mobile robotics, where he worked closely with Huosheng Hu Jan Grothusen, Stephen Smith, Mark Jenkinson, and Ian Reid. This was a collaboration with GEC Electrical Products and led in 1991 to the formation of Guidance Navigation Systems Ltd.  The primary interest of this work was sensor data fusion and the real-time detection of obstacles in a robot vehicle's planned path, leading to a “slalom” manoeuvre to avoid it, or, if this was judged infeasible by the robot, a complete re-planning of the path to the goal.\n\nFinishing a spell as head of engineering science (1989–84), Brady was awarded an EPSRC Senior Fellowship, during which he spent two year-long periods in the INRIA Laboratory headed by Nicholas Ayache.  Brady had begun to switch from robotics to medical imaging, specifically breast cancer, in 1989, following the death of his mother-in-law Dr. Irene Friedlander from the disease.  For the past 29 years he has worked with Ralph Highnam, first supervising Ralph's thesis, then co-authoring a monograph Mammographic Image Analysis, then co-founding Mirada Solutions Ltd and subsequently Volpara Health Technologies (ASX: VHT).  Together, they developed an influential mathematical model of the fluence of X-rays through the female breast as a basis for analysis of mammographic images. This work was done in collaboration with Ralph Highnam and pioneered an entirely novel “physics-based” approach. This attracted the interest of Nico Karssemeijer and led to further collaborations and the company ScreenPoint bv co-founded by Mike and Nico.\nBrady is the ..."

As of March 2006, he is a senior research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Florida.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHayes was educated at the Bentley Grammar School, Calne. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in artificial intelligence on the topic of 'Semantic trees: New foundations for automatic theorem-proving'  from the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nHayes has been an active, prolific, and influential figure in artificial intelligence for over five decades. He has a reputation for being provocative but also quite humorous. \nOne of his earliest publications, with John McCarthy, was the first thorough statement of the basis for the AI field of logical knowledge representation, introducing the notion of situation calculus, representation and reasoning about time, fluents, and the use of logic for representing knowledge in a computer.\nHayes next major contribution was the seminal work on the Naive Physics Manifesto, which anticipated the expert systems movement in many ways \nand called for researchers in AI to actually try to represent knowledge in computers. Although not the first to mention the word \"ontology\" in computer science (that distinction belongs to John McCarthy ), Hayes was one of the first to actually do it, and inspired an entire generation of researchers in knowledge engineering, logical formalisations of commonsense reasoning, and ontology.\nIn the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument \"disproving\" the possibility of AI. The Newcomb Awards are announced in the AI Magazine published by AAAI.\nAt the turn of the century he became active in the Semantic Web community, contributing substantially (perhaps solely) to the revised semantics of RDF known as RDF-Core, one of the three designers (along with Peter Patel-Schneider and Ian Horrocks) of the Web Ontology Language semantics, and most recently contributed to SPARQL.  He is also, along with philosopher Christopher Menzel the primary designer of the ISO Common Logic standard.\nHayes has served as secretary of AISB, chairman and trustee of IJCAI, associate editor of Artificial Intelligence, a governor of the Cognitive Science Society and president of American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Hayes is a charter Fellow of AAAI and of the Cognitive Science Society\nAccording to his website, his current research interests include \"knowledge representation and automatic reasoning, especially the representation of space and time; the semantic web; ontology design; and the philosophical foundations of AI and computer science\".\n\n\n== References ==..."

While earlier face recognition methods have focused on appearance - capturing, representing, and matching facial characteristics as they appear on 2D images in the visible spectrum, the proposed URxD system uses a webcam to capture a continuous video stream which is used to detect whether a person is facing the 3D camera, and if the subject is facing the camera relatively still for more than two seconds, the system triggers the optical scanner and the 3D data are captured. It can also determine whether the person is wearing glasses. The system has achieved the best published results when tried to 4,007 datasets as a part of the international face recognition Grand Challenge organized by NIST in 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIoannis Kakadiaris's rating\nAbout the URxD system's hardware\nAbout \"3D Data Extraction\"\nAbout \"Infrared Mapped onto 3D Data\"\n\"The New Face of Identity...\", University of Huston's 30 July 2007 News Release\nVideo interview with Professor Kakadiaris..."

Rocha is the George J. Klir Professor of Systems Science at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science, Binghamton University (State University of New York). He has been director of the NSF-NRT Complex Networks and Systems graduate Program in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He is also director of the Center for Social and Biomedical Complexity, between Binghamton University and Indiana University, Bloomington, a Fulbright Scholar, and Principal Investigator at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal. His research is on complex systems and networks, computational and systems biology, biomedical complexity and digital health, and computational intelligence (including Artificial Life and Embodied Cognition).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Luanda, Angola, moving to Lisbon, Portugal in his teens and completing an Licentiate (B.A. plus M.S.) in Mechanical and Systems Engineering at the Instituto Superior Técnico. He received his Ph.D in Systems Science in 1997 from the  Binghamton University. From 1998 to 2004 he was a staff scientist at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he founded and led a Complex Systems Modeling Team during 1998-2002, and was part of the Santa Fe Institute research community. He has been the director of the NSF-NRT Interdisciplinary Training Program in Complex Networks and Systems, and Professor of Informatics in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, where he was a member of the advisory council of the Indiana University Network Science Institute, and core faculty of the Cognitive Science Program.  From 2005 to 2015 he was the director of the  Computational Biology Collaboratorium and in the Direction of the PhD program in Computational Biology at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, where he remains a Principal Investigator. He has organized the Tenth International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems (Alife X) and the Ninth European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2007).\n\n\n== Research ==\nDr. Rocha studies the systems properties of natural and artificial systems which enable them to adapt and evolve. He has approached this general topic by investigating how information and redundancy are fundamental for controlling the behavior and evolutionary capabilities of complex systems, as well as abstracting principles from natural systems to produce adaptive information technology.\nAccepting Von Neumann's principle of self-replication and Turing's universal computation as a general principle for generating open-ended complexity that encompasses Natural Selection, Dr. Rocha has developed the work of Howard Pattee, Sydney Brenner, and others who regard computation and information as fundamental to understanding life, cognition and other complex systems (a good overview is Gleick's Book). From this viewpoint, he has approached several questions: how do cells and collectives of cells compute? Is language an evolutionary system operating under the same principle? Can artificial systems implement the same principle? Namely, can collective intelligence on the web become a super-organism implementing this principle?  From these questions, he has worked on various specific research projects ranging from Biomedical Literature Mining and Social Media Mining to understanding redundancy, robustness, modularity and control in Complex Networks,  Collective Intelligence on the Web and in Social Systems, and..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

Practically at the midpoint of the Iberian Peninsula's Atlantic coast, it is located at the mouth of the Mondego River, 40 km (25 mi) west of Coimbra and sheltered by hills (Serra da Boa Viagem), sharing about the same latitude with Philadelphia, Baku and Beijing. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 62,125, in an area of 379.05 km2 (146.35 sq mi). The city of Figueira da Foz proper has a population of 46,600. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.\nIt is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a tourism city, it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest casinos of the Iberian Peninsula – the Casino Figueira.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the legend, the place's name is due to a fig tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. Foz means \"place of discharge\", often used at the point a river meets another body of water, specially where there is a clear energy or water flow clash. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the Neolithic age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this, an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. Julião, to the cathedral Sé Velha of Coimbra.\nKnowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role in the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the shipbuilding and cod drying industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to vila (small town) on 12 March 1771 and turned city (cidade) on 20 September 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained a great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Portuguese nickname of Rainha das Praias (Queen of the Beaches).\nThe municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of Buarcos, the Serra da Boa Viagem – a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside promenade paved with typical Portuguese pavement. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with the archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the Santa Catarina Fort and the old Buarcos Fortress, the Relógio Tower by the main sandy beach, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of Abadias.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Navigator, formerly and still commonly known as Soporcel, and Celbi, part of Altri) and glass (Verallia, part of Saint-Gobain). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries. Until the turn of the 21st century, a factory of the CIMPOR Group was installed in the Mondeg..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory.\nLasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\"\nHer specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIrena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nAfter receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of.\n\n\n== Areas of Study in Applied Mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Optimization ===\nOptimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions.\nThe work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations.\n\n\n=== Control theory ===\nControl Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\"\nIn simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal..."

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129. Google Scholar lists over 200,000 citations, with H = 201.\nStanley..."

He was with Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, Colorado, for almost 21 years, where he is a Professor Emeritus. He was elevated to Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  for applications of artificial intelligence in control of power electronics systems.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSimões was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 1963, to José L.G. Simões and Cecília A.B.G. Simões, with a sister, Maysa A.G. Simões. When he was 11 years old, he had a strong motivation and decided to become an electrical engineer when his cousin, Hélio Adauto de Paula, showed him vacuum tube radios, transistorized audio amplifiers, and took Simões to visit his work as an electrical machine designer in Equacional, a motor manufacturing company in the city of São Paulo.\nSimões was enrolled in an evening Catholic high school from 1978 to 1980, \"Liceu Coração de Jesus\", where he learned electronics as part of a technician degree. At that time, there was a job market for electronic technicians in Brazil, but he wanted to study further, and become an engineer. Therefore, in 1980, Simões took the entrance exams (FUVEST) for the University of São Paulo (USP) and was admitted as a student in \"Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (EPUSP)\". He completed his B.Sc. degree in 1985. In 1982 he was admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of EPUSP and started an internship at FDTE - Fundação para o Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Engenharia. From 1984 to 1985, he focused his expertise in telecommunications, antennas, high frequency, analog, and digital circuits design. His Senior Design in 1985 was a modem with analog and digital circuits implemented for interfacing an 8085 microprocessor, operating on a regular telephone connection. Such a system was made before the age of computers connected on telephone lines via modems. During his four years internship for FDTE, he was learning with senior engineers how to design DC-DC converters and off-line switching mode power supplies, using Phillips manuals for TV flyback circuits and National Instruments handbooks. Those power converters were built and implemented in railroad automation (FEPASA), as well as in the São Paulo Metro subway system. In 1985 Simões graduated from EPUSP and worked as an engineer for a few years with FDTE. He was inspired by several faculty from EPUSP, for example, Prof. Luiz de Queiroz Orsini who taught him modern computer-based electrical and electronics circuits analysis (that time with mainframes, and later on MAC's and PC's), José Roberto Cardoso who taught electrical machines and energy conversion. Simões also learned a lot from Prof. Edson Benedicto Ramos Féris and Prof. Guido Stolfi techniques for analog high-frequency circuit designer. During the Senior year (1985) Simões attended a course from Prof. Waldir Pó on introduction to Power Electronics, where the principles of utilizing thyristors, diodes, and transistors, to control electrical circuits for energy conversion was a transformation in how Simões wanted to further his career, giving him a strong motivation to learn and understand power electronics for controlling machines, ac-dc, dc-ac, and dc-dc power conversion.\nFrom 1986 to 1989, Simões worked for FDTE, at the same time leading technical research with three other partners wh..."

He is professor of computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and director and founder of the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLeymann studied Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and received a Master of Science degree in Mathematics (i.e. Dipl.-Math.) in 1982 from University of Bochum, Germany. He worked as research staff member in the Faculty of Mathematics at University of Bochum, where he obtained his PhD in Mathematics (i.e. Dr. rer. nat.) in 1984. In his PhD thesis he studied foliations on spaces with singularities. After his PhD he went to IBM Research and Development contributing to software products like DB2, Websphere, or MQSeries. Leymann was main co-inventor and chief software architect of IBM's business process management and workflow products, and was appointed IBM Distinguished Engineer for this work. In 2004, he was appointed full professor of computer science at University of Stuttgart where he founded the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems. He holds many granted patents in the area of software.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFrank Leymann's main contributions are from the domains of workflow systems, service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, pattern languages and quantum computing.\n\n\n=== Database management ===\nHis initial focus was on database technology:  \nIn order to simplify queries on relational databases with many tables, Leymann co-developed a universal relation system\non top of existing relational database systems. Contributions to architectural aspects of stored procedures and user defined functions followed. The latter resulted in investigating the use of object databases, especially ObjectStore, as the underpinning of other middleware. At this time, developers were quite unfamiliar with object databases, thus, Leymann helped to create tooling to ensure proper performance of corresponding applications.\n\n\n=== Business process management & workflow systems ===\nWorkflow systems support companies in modeling, optimizing, and executing their business processes in computing environments. Several languages have been proposed for modeling business processes, out which two languages are widely supported in industry: one of which is the OASIS (organization) standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) that Leymann co-invented and which in turn is based on Web Services Flow Language (WSFL), a language that Leymann authored for IBM; the other language is Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), which Leymann co-author too. Such modeling languages support \"programming in the large \" and allow splitting high-level logic of control- and data flow within an overall application from its low-level logic implementing elementary business functions; this way, workflow-based applications can be created, that allow changing business processes without having to change the programs implementing individual steps of the process. \nOften, collections of such steps represent long running transactions, i.e. performed steps must succeed or - in case of an error - must be collectively undone; to support this behavior in business processes Leymann introduced compensating transactions in workflow systems\nBased on his contributions to IBM's workflow products, Leymann co-authored the seminal book \"Production Workflow\" that explains how to build scalable and reliable workflow system..."

She works as a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. As well as for her research, she is known as a creator of mathematical art.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nOsinga earned a master's degree in 1991 and a Ph.D. in 1996 from the University of Groningen. Her doctoral dissertation, jointly supervised by dynamical systems theorist Henk Broer and computational geometer Gert Vegter, was on the computation of invariant manifolds. \nAfter postdoctoral studies at The Geometry Center and the California Institute of Technology, and a short-term lecturership at the University of Exeter, she became a lecturer at the University of Bristol in 2001, and was promoted to reader and professor there in 2005 and 2011, respectively. She moved to Auckland in 2011, becoming the first female mathematics professor at Auckland and the second in New Zealand.\n\n\n== Mathematical art ==\nIn 2004 Osinga created a crocheted visualization of the Lorenz manifold, an invariant manifold for the Lorenz system, and published the crochet pattern for her work with her husband Bernd Krauskopf; the resulting mathematical textile artwork involved over 25,000 crochet stitches, and measured nearly a meter across. Osinga and Krauskopf later collaborated with artist Benjamin Storch on a stainless steel sculpture that provides another interpretation of the same mathematical system.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nOsinga was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014, speaking on \"Mathematics in Science and Technology\". In 2015 she was elected as a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics \"for contributions to theory and computational methods for dynamical systems.\"  In October 2016 she became the first female mathematician elected to the Royal Society of New Zealand. She was awarded the Aitken Lectureship in 2017.\nIn 2017 Osinga was selected as one of the Royal Society Te Apārangi's \"150 women in 150 words\", celebrating the contributions of women to knowledge in New Zealand.

In 2014 Fellows became one of ten inaugural fellows of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Also in 2014, he was named an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand (the first computer scientist to receive this honor). In 2007, Fellows was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. His German host was Rolf Niedermeier and Mike spent part of 2007 and most of 2008 at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität in Jena, Germany, working with Niedermeier. Also in 2007, Mike became one of the first Fellows of the Institute of Advanced Study (Durham), UK and a Fellow of Grey College at the University of Durham. He was also awarded an Australian Research Council Professorial Fellowship for five years, beginning 2010.\nHe is an Area Editor for the Journal of Computer and System Sciences since 2004, and Advising Editor for the special Section on Parameterized Complexity in the same journal. He is Associate Editor for ACM Transactions on Algorithms. In 2008 he was Guest Editor for a special double issue of The Computer Journal containing 15 surveys on parameterized complexity. He is also Guest Editor (with others) for a Special Issue on Parameterized Complexity in the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization to be published in 2010. He is a member of the Steering Committee for the conference series International Workshop on Parameterized and Exact Computation, proceedings published by Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer Science.\nMichael Fellows is co-author of Computer Science Unplugged! www.csunplugged.org book and materials, which bring computational thinking activities to youth and adults and have been translated into over 25 languages. He is known for his innovative science communication. He is an organizer of the Creative Mathematical Sciences Communication (CMSC) conference series. An avid interest in politics was inspired by his mother Betty, long a leader in the California League of Women Voters, and a love of literature and movies is shared with his son, Max. Fellows wrote a series of passion plays about mathematics which were presented at the Victoria Fringe Festival and at NCTM at Asilimar in 1999.\nIn 1999, he married Frances Novak Rosamond, also a scientist, who shares his love of mathematics and adventure.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nFellows is recognized as one of the founders of parameterized complexity, a complexity framework that uses structure in hard problems for the design and analysis of algorithms for their solution. Parameterized complexity has strong connecti..."
