Dey received a Bachelor of Applied Science in computer engineering from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada in 1993. He received a Master of Science in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech in 1995 and then went on to complete a second master's degree and a Ph.D. in computer science, also at Georgia Tech, in 2000. For his dissertation, he researched programming support for building context-aware applications: The Context Toolkit. He was a member of the Future Computing Environments research group in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHis research interests are feedback and control in ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing, toolkits and end-user programming environments, sensor-rich environments, information overload, ambient displays, privacy, human-computer interaction.  He is among the most prolific authors in computer science and human-computer interaction.\n\n\n=== Ubiquitous computing ===\nMuch of Dey's research deals with the construction and intersectional nature of ubiquitous computing. In 2002, in a research project at the University of California, Berkeley alongside Scott Lederer and Jennifer Mankoff, the team developed a conceptual model exploring the tangibility and accessibility of everyday end-user privacy in ubicomp environments. The model takes considerations from societal influences, contextual factors, and subjectivity to develop a far-reaching scope for ubicomp privacy. The model was then used to explore an interactional metaphor called situational faces, which makes the issue of privacy in ubiquitous computing environments more accessible to users. This facade presents an abstraction of advanced privacy settings to allow users to more easily establish their preferences.\n\n\n=== Smart homes and intelligent environments ===\nIn 2006, Dey developed a research paper alongside Min Kyung Lee, Scott Davidoff, and John Zimmerman, all of Carnegie Mellon University, exploring and evaluating the usage of home automation technology and their effects on family life. As a collaboration between the School of Design and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the research sought to uncover areas of human-centered design that could complement family life, thus providing insight on the potential roles a smart home could play. Following a heuristic design process, the team interviewed dual-income families in their own homes, gauging  cultural and ethnographic information, leading to the generation and experimentation of a design concept. The study concluded that such accommodations would allow families to avoid breakdowns in developed routines and improve emotional connectivity between family members and the home, while allowing parents to devote more time and attention to children.\n\n\n=== Context awareness and self-monitoring technologies ===\nIn 2010, Dey, alongside Dana Pavel and V..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

Aylett (born 1951) is a British author, computer scientist, professor, poet and political activist. She is a professor of computer science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, where she specialises in affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAylett's research involves affective computing, social computing, software agents, and human–robot interaction. She is the leader of Socially Competent Robots (SoCoRo), a project of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council that studies whether robots can assist autistic people in learning to recognize facial expressions and other social cues.\nShe has also studied the use of \"emotionally literate\" robots for tutoring schoolchildren, developed interactive role-playing software intended to combat bullying, and performed with a robot poet named Sarah the Poetic Robot as part of the Edinburgh Free Fringe.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAylett earned a degree in mathematical economics at the London School of Economics, and began her career in computing by working in technical support at International Computers Limited for three years, before moving to the University of Sheffield to work in computing and robotics. She became a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University for five years, and then moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1989, as part of the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute there. She moved again to the University of Salford in 1992, first as part of the IT Institute there and later in the Centre for Virtual Environments. There, she became Professor of Intelligent Virtual Environments in 2000. In 2004, she moved to her present position at Heriot-Watt University.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAylett's book Robots: Bringing Intelligent Machines to Life? (2002) is a historical exploration on robots, on the history of robotics, and on research problems confronting roboticists. Aimed at high-school age students, it consists of a sequence of two-page illustrated spreads on each of its topics.\nShe is the coauthor, with Judy Robertson, Lisa Gjedde, Rose Luckin and Paul Brna, of the self-published book Inside Stories: A Narrative Journey (2008), on the use of story-telling in education and the use of technology to assist in storytelling.\nAylett is also the coauthor of the poetry pamphlet Handfast: Poetry Duets with Beth McDonough (Mothers Milk, 2016). It has a challenge-response format, in which a poem by one of the authors inspires a poem by the other author exploring the same theme.\n\n\n== Family and politics ==\nAylett was born in London. She is the mother of writer and activist Owen Jones. She met her husband, union organiser Robert Jones, through their membership in the Militant tendency, a Trotskyist group within the Labour Party. He developed prostate cancer, and died in 2018.\nAs a political activist, Aylett has advocated for the Labour Party, for improved labour security for university staff, for permanent residency for European Union citizens already in the UK at the time of Brexit, for academic freedom for faculty and students in the face of the 'Counter-terrorism and security bill' legislation by signing a letter claiming the bill ran counter to universities mission to foster free speech as well as being 'unenforceable' and 'unlawful', as well as support for transgender rights. She has served as one of the leaders of the Labour Party in Edinburgh Southern.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nRut..."

Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRonald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993.\n\n\n== Research and philosophy ==\nProfessor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the Information Age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\"\nDay's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDay has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006.\nDay's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence.\nIn 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data..."

In 1991 he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was appointed Professor of Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. He is also Senior Fellow in the Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto.\nHe is elected Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and elected fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advance Research.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFox's current research interests concern smart cities, in particular \"ontologies for modelling cities and their performance, causal analysis of crowd sourced data (e.g., analysis of reports provided by citizens to the city), and process mapping and analysis of city services (e.g., social services).\"\nIn the past he has been particularly interested the fields of \"enterprise engineering (i.e., information technology for business process engineering), constrained-directed reasoning, a unified theory of scheduling, enterprise modelling (i.e., TOVE) and coordination theory.\"\n\n\n=== TOVE project ===\n\nThe TOVE project, acronym of TOronto Virtual Enterprise project is a project to develop an ontological framework for enterprise integration (EI) based on and suited for enterprise modeling. In the beginning of the 1990s it was initiated by Mark S. Fox and others at the University of Toronto . Initially the project had defined four goals:\n\nprovides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,\ndefines the meaning of each term (aka semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as possible\nimplements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable TOVE to automatically deduce the answer to many \"common sense\" questions about the enterprise, and\ndefines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical context.\nThe TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering.\n\n\n=== Enterprise modeling ===\nIn the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Grüninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating:\n\nIn enterprise modelling, we want to define the actions performed within an enterprise, and define constraints for plans and schedules which are constructed to satisfy the goals of the enterprise.

His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government.\nOn 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.\nGisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title “Club of the Year” by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1995, Gisin transmitted a quantum cryptographic signal at a distance of 23 km over a commercial optical fiber under Lake Geneva. Later, his group extended this record to 67 km  and 307 km  using Plug-&-Play and Coherent One Way configurations for quantum key distribution.\nIn 1997, Nicolas Gisin and his group demonstrated Bell inequality violations at a distance of over 10 km. This was the first time when quantum non-locality was demonstrated outside the lab; the distance was increased by about three orders of magnitude with respect to all previous experiments. This was followed by further experiments, ever strengthening the conclusion by excluding more and more sophisticated alternative models to quantum theory.\nIn the early 2000s he was the first in demonstrating quantum teleportation over long distances. In the latter experiment the receiving photon was hundreds of meters away when the Bell state measurement that triggers the teleportation process was performed.\nThe previous breakthroughs would not have been possible without single-photon detectors compatible with telecommunication optical fibers. When Gisin entered the field such detectors did not exist. Today, thanks to Gisin and his group at the University of Geneva, single-photon detectors at telecom wavelengths are commercially available.\nNicolas Gisin’s work pushed optical fiber quantum communication almo..."

He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (s, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (c, = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (Φ, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (w). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\", for example   \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for   S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            \n                              |\n                            \n                            \n                              \n                                |\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    NCS 1950\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Standard\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n    ..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

As the political conflict in Argentina increased, Dahl attended graduate school in  France. In 1977, she was the first graduate at the Université d'Aix-Marseille to receive a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile involved in the research for her doctorate, Dahl became a pioneer in the field of logic programming, developing both the first logic programming database system, and an (also logic-programmed) front end to consult it in a human language (Spanish). Dahl's research and methodologies became multi-disciplinary including Computational Linguistics, Computational Molecular Biology, and Artificial Intelligence. She became an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1991. In 1996 she was honoured by the Logic Programming Association as one of the 15 founders of the Logic Programming Field, and has extensively pioneered as well the areas of Logic Grammars and Constraint Handling Rules.\nDahl is a woman pioneer in a male-dominated field. She fought gender inequality while she was a professor at Simon Fraser University, both through mentoring and role modelling, and through concrete actions. After Simon Fraser University refused to reimburse her $17 for childcare expenses while she was delivering a guest speech in Victoria, where she’d traveled with her nursing baby, she went first to her department and then Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) with her protest, which ended with the NSERC changing their policy to make childcare a covered expense for nursing researchers they funded. She proposed and actively promoted the provision of childcare at logic programming conferences, until it was adopted formally into their constitution, and is now routinely offered as a result. She also obtained a change in SFU's legislation when it resulted in her graduate student being timed out for delays caused by life-threatening medical conditions upon birthing twins.\nShe has developed numerous international research projects and collaborations, most notably with Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France, and worked with IBM, Vancouver Software Labs, International Artificial Intelligence. In her work with IBM, she obtained a record-breaking research contract. She served as president of the Association of Logic Programming from 2001-2005. She was awarded the prestigious Marie Curie Chair of Excellence 2008-2011 from the European Commission for her pioneering work on Constraint Solving and Language Processing for Bioinformatics. In 2012 she quit her Full Professor position at Simon Fraser University in order to focus on research. SFU awarded her Lifetime Professor Emerits status as from 2013.  Her research program continues under NSERC funding, as well as through her own AI company, Regenerative AI, and she serves at the Scientific Advisory Board of IMDEA Software. She balances her scientific activities with artistic ones, as a student of music, theatre and dance, and performs regularly as singer and guitarist in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Research ==\nDahl's research is focused on \"bridging the gap between the formal and the humanistic sciences, and to achieve more human-like communication with c..."

Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."
