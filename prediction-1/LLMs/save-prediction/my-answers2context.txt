He is the Dean of the University of Washington Information School. Dey is formerly the director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie at the intersection of human–computer interaction and ubiquitous computing, focusing on how to make novel technologies more usable and useful. In particular, he builds tools that make it easier to build useful ubiquitous computing applications and supporting end users in controlling their ubiquitous computing systems.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDey was born in Canada and now resides in Seattle, Washington. Dey received a Bachelor of Applied Science in computer engineering from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada in 1993. He received a Master of Science in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech in 1995 and then went on to complete a second master's degree and a Ph.D. in computer science, also at Georgia Tech, in 2000. For his dissertation, he researched programming support for building context-aware applications: The Context Toolkit. He was a member of the Future Computing Environments research group in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHis research interests are feedback and control in ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing, toolkits and end-user programming environments, sensor-rich environments, information overload, ambient displays, privacy, human-computer interaction.  He is among the most prolific authors in computer science and human-computer interaction.\n\n\n=== Ubiquitous computing ===\nMuch of Dey's research deals with the construction and intersectional nature of ubiquitous computing. In 2002, in a research project at the University of California, Berkeley alongside Scott Lederer and Jennifer Mankoff, the team developed a conceptual model exploring the tangibility and accessibility of everyday end-user privacy in ubicomp environments. The model takes considerations from societal influences, contextual factors, and subjectivity to develop a far-reaching scope for ubicomp privacy. The model was then used to explore an interactional metaphor called situational faces, which makes the issue of privacy in ubiquitous computing environments more accessible to users. This facade presents an abstraction of advanced privacy settings to allow users to more easily establish their preferences.\n\n\n=== Smart homes and intelligent environments ===\nIn 2006, Dey developed a research paper alongside Min Kyung Lee, Scott Davidoff, and John Zimmerman, all of Carnegie Mellon University, exploring and evaluating the usage of home automation technology and their effects on family life. As a collaboration between the School of Design and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the research sought to uncover areas of human-centered design that could complement family life, thus providing insight on the potential roles a smart home could play. Following a heuristic design process, the team interviewed dual-income families in their own homes, gauging  cultural and ethnographic information, leading to the generation and experimentation of a design concept. The study concluded that such accommodations would allow families to avoid breakdowns in developed routines and improve emotional connectivity between family members and the home, while allowing parents to devote more time and attention to children.\n\n\n=== Context awareness and self-monitoring technologies ===\nIn 2010, Dey, alongside Dana Pavel and V..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRonald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993.\n\n\n== Research and philosophy ==\nProfessor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the Information Age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\"\nDay's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDay has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006.\nDay's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence.\nIn 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data..."

In 1991 he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was appointed Professor of Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. He is also Senior Fellow in the Global Cities Institute at the University of Toronto.\nHe is elected Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and elected fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advance Research.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFox's current research interests concern smart cities, in particular \"ontologies for modelling cities and their performance, causal analysis of crowd sourced data (e.g., analysis of reports provided by citizens to the city), and process mapping and analysis of city services (e.g., social services).\"\nIn the past he has been particularly interested the fields of \"enterprise engineering (i.e., information technology for business process engineering), constrained-directed reasoning, a unified theory of scheduling, enterprise modelling (i.e., TOVE) and coordination theory.\"\n\n\n=== TOVE project ===\n\nThe TOVE project, acronym of TOronto Virtual Enterprise project is a project to develop an ontological framework for enterprise integration (EI) based on and suited for enterprise modeling. In the beginning of the 1990s it was initiated by Mark S. Fox and others at the University of Toronto . Initially the project had defined four goals:\n\nprovides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,\ndefines the meaning of each term (aka semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as possible\nimplements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable TOVE to automatically deduce the answer to many \"common sense\" questions about the enterprise, and\ndefines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical context.\nThe TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering.\n\n\n=== Enterprise modeling ===\nIn the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Grüninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating:\n\nIn enterprise modelling, we want to define the actions performed within an enterprise, and define constraints for plans and schedules which are constructed to satisfy the goals of the enterprise.

His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government.\nOn 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.\nGisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title “Club of the Year” by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1995, Gisin transmitted a quantum cryptographic signal at a distance of 23 km over a commercial optical fiber under Lake Geneva. Later, his group extended this record to 67 km  and 307 km  using Plug-&-Play and Coherent One Way configurations for quantum key distribution.\nIn 1997, Nicolas Gisin and his group demonstrated Bell inequality violations at a distance of over 10 km. This was the first time when quantum non-locality was demonstrated outside the lab; the distance was increased by about three orders of magnitude with respect to all previous experiments. This was followed by further experiments, ever strengthening the conclusion by excluding more and more sophisticated alternative models to quantum theory.\nIn the early 2000s he was the first in demonstrating quantum teleportation over long distances. In the latter experiment the receiving photon was hundreds of meters away when the Bell state measurement that triggers the teleportation process was performed.\nThe previous breakthroughs would not have been possible without single-photon detectors compatible with telecommunication optical fibers. When Gisin entered the field such detectors did not exist. Today, thanks to Gisin and his group at the University of Geneva, single-photon detectors at telecom wavelengths are commercially available.\nNicolas Gisin’s work pushed optical fiber quantum communication almo..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences.

It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (s, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (c, = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (Φ, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (w). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\", for example   \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for   S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            \n                              |\n                            \n                            \n                              \n                                |\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    NCS 1950\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Standard\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n    ..."

His contributions have included innovations in data structures and algorithms, programming abstractions, and runtime systems. He has pioneered the use of autonomic computing techniques to address application/system complexity and uncertainty. He has also deployed open-source software encapsulating these research innovations, which directly impact a range of applications.\nA leader in structured adaptive mesh refinement, Parashar is one of the earliest researchers to address scalable SAMR. His research has included a theoretical framework for locality preserving distributed and dynamic data-structures for SAMR, programming abstractions that enable distributed, dynamically adaptive formulations to be directly expressed, and a family of innovative partitioning algorithms that incorporate system/applications characteristics, and mechanisms for actively managing SAMR grid-hierarchies. These contributions continue to enable truly scalable SAMR applications and have led to realistic simulations of complex phenomena, such as colliding black-holes and neutron stars, forest fire propagation, and fluid flows in the human heart.\nAs Assistant Director for Strategic Computing in the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, Parashar led the development of a national strategy for the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem and the formulation of the National Strategic Computing Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince becoming Office Director at the National Science Foundation’s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, Parashar has led the development of NSF’s strategic vision for a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem for 21st century science and engineering.

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

As the political conflict in Argentina increased, Dahl attended graduate school in  France. In 1977, she was the first graduate at the Université d'Aix-Marseille to receive a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile involved in the research for her doctorate, Dahl became a pioneer in the field of logic programming, developing both the first logic programming database system, and an (also logic-programmed) front end to consult it in a human language (Spanish). Dahl's research and methodologies became multi-disciplinary including Computational Linguistics, Computational Molecular Biology, and Artificial Intelligence. She became an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1991. In 1996 she was honoured by the Logic Programming Association as one of the 15 founders of the Logic Programming Field, and has extensively pioneered as well the areas of Logic Grammars and Constraint Handling Rules.\nDahl is a woman pioneer in a male-dominated field. She fought gender inequality while she was a professor at Simon Fraser University, both through mentoring and role modelling, and through concrete actions. After Simon Fraser University refused to reimburse her $17 for childcare expenses while she was delivering a guest speech in Victoria, where she’d traveled with her nursing baby, she went first to her department and then Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) with her protest, which ended with the NSERC changing their policy to make childcare a covered expense for nursing researchers they funded. She proposed and actively promoted the provision of childcare at logic programming conferences, until it was adopted formally into their constitution, and is now routinely offered as a result. She also obtained a change in SFU's legislation when it resulted in her graduate student being timed out for delays caused by life-threatening medical conditions upon birthing twins.\nShe has developed numerous international research projects and collaborations, most notably with Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France, and worked with IBM, Vancouver Software Labs, International Artificial Intelligence. In her work with IBM, she obtained a record-breaking research contract. She served as president of the Association of Logic Programming from 2001-2005. She was awarded the prestigious Marie Curie Chair of Excellence 2008-2011 from the European Commission for her pioneering work on Constraint Solving and Language Processing for Bioinformatics.

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

Nakhleh (Arabic): لؤي نخله; born May 8, 1974) is a Palestinian-Israeli-American computer scientist and computational biologist who is the William and Stephanie Sick Dean of the George R. Brown School of Engineering, a professor of Computer Science and a professor of BioSciences at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNakhleh was born on May 8, 1974, to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds both U.S. and Israeli citizenship.\nNakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. Tandy Warnow, in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, and became a Full Professor in 2016.  He served as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science from July 2018 until December 2020. Nakhleh served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Rice University from 2017 to 2020.\nIn addition to his duties as the Dean of Engineering at Rice University, Nakhleh currently teaches courses in discrete mathematics and computational biology. Nakhleh has received high acclaim at Rice University for his skills in teaching, and he is the recipient of many awards in this area.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nNakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and comparative genomics under \nscenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious phylogenetic networks: networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to reticulate evolution. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) \nevolutionary history of the Indo-European languages. Their paper on perfect phylogenetic networks was included as one of the 20 best papers published in Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America, in the 30-year period 1986–2016.\nLater, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably incomplete lineage sorting. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies coalescent with gene flow.\nAdditionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics.\nNakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet, an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nNakhleh's honors and awards include:\n\nThe National Science Foundation CAREER Award, 2009.\nThe Sloan Fellowship in the Molecular Biology category, 2010.\nThe Guggenheim Fellowship in the Organismic Biology and Ecology category, 2012.\n\n\n== References ==..."

She is the Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. She is known as a founder of the fields of rescue robotics and human-robot interaction and for inserting robots into disasters. Her case studies of how unmanned systems under perform in the field led cognitive systems engineering researcher David Woods to pose the (Robin) Murphy's Law of Autonomy: a deployment of robotic systems will fall short of the target level of autonomy, creating or exacerbating a shortfall in mechanisms for coordination with human problem holders. Her TED talk “These Robots Come to the Rescue After a Disaster” was listed in TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking as one of the examples of a good TED talk. Murphy is also known for using science fiction as an innovative method of teaching artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\n\n== Early years and education ==\nMurphy was raised in Douglas, Georgia. She received her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1980, worked in the process safety industry, and returned to Georgia Tech for a master's (1988) and PhD. (1992) in computer science under the direction of Ronald Arkin. She was the first person to graduate from the Georgia Tech College of Computing with a PhD in robotics. She was an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines from 1992 to 1998, then moved to the University of South Florida as an associate professor in 1998 and was promoted to full professor in 2003. In 2008, Murphy moved to Texas A&M University. She was a member of the Defense Science Study Group from 1997 to 1998; this led to her involvement on numerous science boards, including the Defense Science Board and the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board.\n\n\n== Career in robotics ==\n\n\n=== Disaster robotics ===\nMurphy began research into disaster robotics in 1995, motivated by the Oklahoma City bombing.  Murphy was the director of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASASR)  from 2002 to 2018, and now serves as the vice-president. Through CRASAR she participated in the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster (2001), considered the first use of robots for the emergency response phase of a disaster. Since then she has helped insert unmanned ground, aerial, and marine systems into 27 disasters including Hurricane Katrina, which is considered the first use of small unmanned aerial systems, the Fukishima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011), the Tōhoku tsunami (2011),  the Syrian Boat Refugee crisis (2016), and Hurricane Harvey (2017). She wrote the seminal text Disaster Robotics, MIT Press, in 2014.\n\n\n=== Science fiction ===\nMurphy's book, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Robotics: Case Studies of Successful Systems  was cited by Michael Crichton in Prey.\nShe inspired the character of Jae, a rescue roboticist who worked at Disaster City, in Skinner, a science fiction book by Charlie Huston.\nMurphy has edited a book, Robotics Through Science Fiction: Artificial Intelligence Explained Through Six Classic Robot Short Stories by Isaac Asimov, Brian Aldiss, Vernor Vinge, and Philip K. Dick, to illustrate key principles in programming artificial intelligence for robotics. The book was originally intended as a companion to the second edition of her textbook Introduction to AI Robotics but it serves as a stand-alone book for a non-technical audience.\nSince 2018, she writes monthly 'sc..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

It builds on previous research linking language patterns with mental states and traits but is more efficient and objective than hand coding methods. Pennebaker and his collaborators have used LIWC to analyze the language of Al Qaeda leaders and of political candidates, particularly in the 2008 United States presidential election. The use of LIWC is widespread, particularly in the social-behavioral and computer sciences. It is commonly used to examine group and individual differences in communication and writing, the influence of context on language use, social dynamics in close relationships, and language patterns associated with deception and insider threats.

His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics. He has contributed work in the fields of experimental quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication over standard telecom optical fibers. He also co-founded ID Quantique, a company that provides quantum-based technologies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicolas Gisin was born in Geneva on 29 May 1952. He received a degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics before receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Geneva in 1981. His dissertation concerned quantum and statistical physics. After several years in the software and optical communication industries, Gisin joined the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva in 1994, where he started working in optics. Since 2000, he has been the Director of the Department of Applied Physics, leading a research group in Quantum information and quantum communication. The European Research Council awarded him with two successive ERC Advanced Grants. In 2009, he received the first biennial John Stewart Bell Prize and, in 2011, he received the prize of the Geneva City. In 2014, Switzerland awarded him the Swiss Science prize sponsored by the Foundation Marcel Benoist and delivered by the National Government.\nOn 17 July 2014, Gisin published his book, Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation, and Other Quantum Marvels, in which he explains modern quantum physics and its applications without using mathematics or difficult concepts. The text has been translated from French into English, German, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.\nGisin played at the highest Swiss level and was president of Servette HC from 2000 to 2015, furthering his club to become the largest in Switzerland. In 2010 Servette HC was awarded the title “Club of the Year” by the European Hockey Federation. In 2014, the team won the Swiss championship for the first time in its century-long history.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1995, Gisin transmitted a quantum cryptographic signal at a distance of 23 km over a commercial optical fiber under Lake Geneva. Later, his group extended this record to 67 km  and 307 km  using Plug-&-Play and Coherent One Way configurations for quantum key distribution.\nIn 1997, Nicolas Gisin and his group demonstrated Bell inequality violations at a distance of over 10 km. This was the first time when quantum non-locality was demonstrated outside the lab; the distance was increased by about three orders of magnitude with respect to all previous experiments. This was followed by further experiments, ever strengthening the conclusion by excluding more and more sophisticated alternative models to quantum theory.\nIn the early 2000s he was the first in demonstrating quantum teleportation over long distances. In the latter experiment the receiving photon was hundreds of meters away when the Bell state measurement that triggers the teleportation process was performed.\nThe previous breakthroughs would not have been possible without single-photon detectors compatible with telecommunication optical fibers. When Gisin entered the field such detectors did not exist. Today, thanks to Gisin and his group at the University of Geneva, single-photon detectors at telecom wavelengths are commercially available.\nNicolas Gisin’s work pushed optical fiber quantum communication almo..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

There, he holds the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Chair in Information and Computer Science.  Savage is widely cited in computer security, particularly in the areas of email spam, network worms and malware propagation, distributed denial of service (DDOS) mitigation and traceback, automotive hacking and wireless security. He received his undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington (2002).\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published \"Sting\", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement.\nIn 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems.\nIn 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks. Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer.\nIn 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network.\nIn 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were \"propagating\", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005.\nIn 2005, Ishwar Ramani and Stefan Savage developed Syncscan algorithm that cuts the time needed to switch between Wi-Fi access points.\nIn 2004, Savage was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship, in 2010 he was named a Fe..."

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129.

Day is a librarian and a professor of Information and Library Science at Indiana University in Bloomington where he specializes in research on the culture and history of \"information, documentation, knowledge, and communication\" in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Ronald Day is a significant scholar in the field of library and information science having contributed the first major work on the 20th century French librarian and information scientist Suzanne Briet, known as \"Madame Documentation,\" and publishing more than forty works on the intersection of critical theory and library science. Day is one of the few modern critical theorists in the field of library and information science that foregrounds much of his work in the discipline of rhetoric.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRonald E. Day received his Master's in Philosophy in 1987 and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1990 from the Binghamton University. He received his master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993.\n\n\n== Research and philosophy ==\nProfessor Day challenges the enthusiastic assumption that the Information Age is upon us and that it is changing our lives for the better. He contends that the rhetoric of the information age \"is deconstructed geographically as well as temporally, and not the least because geography - in the sense of culture - is historically inflected.\" He bases this assumption on his experience in the Detroit, Michigan area where he moved to after living in San Francisco, California.  In comparing the two regions, Day submits that California has a \"mythological state surrounded by a rhetorical aura of being forward looking\" that lent itself to being described by \"modernist tropes.\"\nDay's research approach focusses on critical information studies and critical informatics and foregrounds his analysis in the rhetorical, conceptual, and historical aspects of information and documentation.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDay has written and edited four books.  His first book, The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power was published in 2001 by the Southern Illinois University Press is an attempt \"to understand the interlinking of a variety of historical streams into a discourse on \"information\".' This is done from the perspective of literary and critical theory, with the objective of understanding how the concept of 'information' is embedded in modern culture.\"  Day does this through the story of Suzanne Briet, the French librarian, author, historian, poet, and author of Qu'est-ce que la documentation? (What is Documentation?), where she viewed \"documentation as a movement towards the coordination of organizational activity through standardization.\" Much of the work for this book went towards an eventual English translation of Briet's book with two other editors in 2006.\nDay's next book was an edited collection with Claire R. McInerney entitled Rethinking Knowledge Management: From Knowledge Objects to Knowledge Processes which looked at fundamental issues in knowledge management and knowledge processes. Specifically, the essays covered insights into knowledge management in organizations and societies that went beyond traditional information acquisition and processing by privileging the creative potential of human expression, communication, and meaningful personal and social existence.\nIn 2014 Day published Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data..."

Hollerbach, Tomàs Lozano-Pérez, and Matt Mason on robotics, who together published an early influential collection of articles and founded a seminal series of conferences.\nArriving in Oxford in 1985, he established the Robotics Laboratory and recruited Andrew Blake, Andrew Zisserman, Stephen Cameron, Hugh Durrant-Whyte, Lionel Tarassenko, Alison Noble, and David Murray. His initial focus was on mobile robotics, where he worked closely with Huosheng Hu Jan Grothusen, Stephen Smith, Mark Jenkinson, and Ian Reid. This was a collaboration with GEC Electrical Products and led in 1991 to the formation of Guidance Navigation Systems Ltd.  The primary interest of this work was sensor data fusion and the real-time detection of obstacles in a robot vehicle's planned path, leading to a “slalom” manoeuvre to avoid it, or, if this was judged infeasible by the robot, a complete re-planning of the path to the goal.\n\nFinishing a spell as head of engineering science (1989–84), Brady was awarded an EPSRC Senior Fellowship, during which he spent two year-long periods in the INRIA Laboratory headed by Nicholas Ayache.  Brady had begun to switch from robotics to medical imaging, specifically breast cancer, in 1989, following the death of his mother-in-law Dr. Irene Friedlander from the disease.  For the past 29 years he has worked with Ralph Highnam, first supervising Ralph's thesis, then co-authoring a monograph Mammographic Image Analysis, then co-founding Mirada Solutions Ltd and subsequently Volpara Health Technologies (ASX: VHT).  Together, they developed an influential mathematical model of the fluence of X-rays through the female breast as a basis for analysis of mammographic images. This work was done in collaboration with Ralph Highnam and pioneered an entirely novel “physics-based” approach. This attracted the interest of Nico Karssemeijer and led to further collaborations and the company ScreenPoint bv co-founded by Mike and Nico.\nBrady is the ..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

W. Hudson Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJulia Linn Bell Hirschberg received her first Ph.D degree in History (16th-century Mexico) from University of Michigan in 1976. She served on the History faculty of Smith College from 1974 to 1982.  She subsequently shifted to Computer Science studies, receiving her M.S. in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1982 and a Ph.D in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1985.\nUpon graduation from University of Pennsylvania in 1985, Hirschberg joined AT&T Bell Labs as a Member of Technical staff in the Linguistics Research Department, where she worked on improving prosody assignment for Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) in the Bell Labs TTS system. She was promoted to Department Head in 1994 when she created a new Human Computer Interface Research Lab.  She and her department remained at Bell Labs until 1996 when they moved to AT&T Labs Research as part of a corporate reorganization.  In 2002, she joined the Columbia University faculty as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science. She served as Chair of the Computer Science Department from 2012 to 2018.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHirschberg's research has included prosody, discourse structure, spoken dialogue systems, speech search, and more recently analysis of deceptive speech. Hirschberg was among the first to combine Natural Language Processing  (NLP) approaches to discourse and dialogue with speech research.  She pioneered techniques in text analysis for prosody assignment in Text-to-Speech synthesis at Bell laboratories in the 1980s and 1990s,  developing corpus-based statistical models based upon syntactic and discourse information which are in general use today in TTS systems. With Janet Pierrehumbert, she developed a theoretical model of intonational meaning. She was a leader in the development of the ToBI conventions for intonational description, which have been extended to numerous languages and which today are the most widely used standard for intonational annotation.\nHirschberg has been a pioneer together with Gregory Ward in much experimental work on intonational sources of language meaning and how these interact with pragmatic phenomena, particularly on the meaning of accent (intonational prominent) items and the meaning of intonational contours. She also has innovated in numerous other areas involving prosody and meaning, including the role of grammatical function and surface position in pitch accent location,  the use of prosody in disambiguating cue phrases (discourse markers) with Diane Litman,  the role of prosody in disambiguation in English, Italian, and Spanish with Cinzia Avesani and Pilar Prieto,  and the automatic identification of speech recognition errors using prosodic information,  At AT&T Labs she worked with Fernando Pereira, Steve Whittaker, and others on speech search  and developing new interfaces for speech navigation.  At Columbia, she and her students have continued and extended research on spoken dialogue systems (automatically detecting speech..."

While earlier face recognition methods have focused on appearance - capturing, representing, and matching facial characteristics as they appear on 2D images in the visible spectrum, the proposed URxD system uses a webcam to capture a continuous video stream which is used to detect whether a person is facing the 3D camera, and if the subject is facing the camera relatively still for more than two seconds, the system triggers the optical scanner and the 3D data are captured. It can also determine whether the person is wearing glasses. The system has achieved the best published results when tried to 4,007 datasets as a part of the international face recognition Grand Challenge organized by NIST in 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIoannis Kakadiaris's rating\nAbout the URxD system's hardware\nAbout \"3D Data Extraction\"\nAbout \"Infrared Mapped onto 3D Data\"\n\"The New Face of Identity...\", University of Huston's 30 July 2007 News Release\nVideo interview with Professor Kakadiaris..."

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

He obtained his bachelor's degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1987, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1991. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, he was with the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Laboratories. His research has included formal modeling and analysis of reactive systems, hybrid systems, model checking, software verification, design automation for embedded software, and program synthesis. He is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and has served as the chair of ACM SIGBED (Special Interest Group on Embedded Systems). He holds the title of Zisman Family Professor at UPenn since 2003.\n\nOver the past thirty years, Alur has introduced several novel models of computation that provide the theoretical foundations for analysis, design, synthesis, and verification of computer systems. While rooted in algorithms and logic, his research, with over 52,000 citations, has found applications in control theory, cyber-physical systems, multi-agent systems, and program synthesis. The specific contributions listed below are highlights of his high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science, for which he is recognized with the 2024 Knuth Prize.\nTimed Automata: Classical model checking was developed for the analysis of finite-state discrete systems. In a ground breaking paper in ICALP 1991, Alur and Dill introduced an extension of automata with continuous timers. They proposed an algorithm to analyze the resulting infinite-state systems by introducing a novel notion of time-abstract bisimulation for algorithmic construction of finite-state quotients. This framework of timed automata has become the standard formal model for real-time systems inspiring a lot of research in specification logics, verification algorithms, formal language theory, and control theory. Problems such as \"does a communication protocol deadlock?\" and \"synthesize the most general controller to maintain safety\", in the presence of timing constraints, can be formulated and solved using decision problems on timed automata. These algorithms have been implemented in many tools and applied to debugging real-world examples. Their work on timed automata is one of the most highly cited papers in theoretical computer science: the TCS’95 journal version has now over 10K citations. For this work, Alur and Dill were awarded the inaugural Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) award in 2008 and the inaugural Alonzo Church Award for outstanding contributions in logic and computation in 2016.\nReal-time Temporal Logics: A related line of research concerns extensions of temporal logics to specify real-time requirements. This work provides a foundational study of different variants based on the modalities used (branching time versus linear-time), the underlying semantics for time (dense versus discrete), and the primitives allowed in syntax for expressing timing constraints. In a sequence of papers, Alur and coauthors identified the syntactic and semantic restrictions necessary for decidability and developed optimal model-checking algorithms wheneve..."

She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Katherine Horony (also Harony (original family name from Hungary), Haroney, and Horoney) was born on November 7, 1850, in Érsekújvár, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Nové Zámky, Slovakia). She was the second daughter of Hungarian physician and teacher Mihály Horony (1817–1865) and Katalin Boldizsár (1830–1865).\n\n\n=== Immigration to the United States ===\n\nIn 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in New York City on the German ship Bremen in September.\nThe Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of Davenport, Iowa, in 1862. Horony and his wife died within a month of one another in 1865. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith. The 1870 United States Census records for Davenport show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.\n\n\n=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===\nIn 1866, at age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for St. Louis, Missouri. Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named Silas Melvin with whom she had a son, and that both died of yellow fever. The United States Census records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met Doc Holliday in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.\nResearcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanche Tribole in St. Louis. In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a \"sporting woman\" (prostitute) in a \"sporting house\" (brothel) in Dodge City, Kansas, run by Nellie \"Bessie\" (Ketchum) Earp, James Earp's wife.\n\n\n== Joins Doc Holliday ==\n\nIn 1876, Kate moved to Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal. The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently, but made up after fights despite the volatile relationship.\nAccording to Kate, the couple later married in Valdosta, Georgia. They traveled to Trinidad, Colorado, and then to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nBy her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brother..."

She has represented New Zealand at four Summer Paralympic Games from 2008, winning a total of eleven gold medals, seven silver medals and one bronze medal, making her New Zealand's most successful Paralympian. She has also represented New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Christchurch on 8 January 1993 to Garry and Jo Pascoe, Sophie grew up on a lifestyle block near Halswell on the south-western outskirts of the city. She has one older sister, Rebecca. On 23 September 1995, Pascoe was accidentally run over by her father on the family ride-on lawnmower. As a result of the accident, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln.\nPascoe began swimming at the age of 7, and from the age of 8 up until 2022, was coached by Roly Crichton. She trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nPascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley.\nAt the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal.\nFollowing the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming. In February 2012, Pascoe became the inaugural winner of the Disabled Sportsperson of the Year award at the 2011 Halberg Awards.\nAt the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe competed in six events – the four in which she won medals at the 2008 Paralympics, plus the 50m freestyle (S10) and 100m freestyle (SM10) events. She successfully defended her 200 m individual medley (SM10) gold medal, breaking her own world record by four seconds with a time of 2:25.65. She also won gold medals in the 100 m butterfly (S10), where she bettered her silver at Beijing and in the process setting a new world record with a time of 1:04.43, and in the 100 m freestyle (S10), setting a new Paralympic record with a time of 1:00.89. Pascoe won silver medals in the 50 m freestyle (S10), 100 m backstroke (S10), and 100 m breaststroke (SB9).\nIn March 2013, Pascoe broke her own world record for the 50m butterfly at the New Zealand Swimming Championships in Auckland, setting a time of 29.21 seconds.\nAt the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Pascoe competed in five events, dropping the 100 m breaststroke SB9.

She has also represented New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Christchurch on 8 January 1993 to Garry and Jo Pascoe, Sophie grew up on a lifestyle block near Halswell on the south-western outskirts of the city. She has one older sister, Rebecca. On 23 September 1995, Pascoe was accidentally run over by her father on the family ride-on lawnmower. As a result of the accident, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln.\nPascoe began swimming at the age of 7, and from the age of 8 up until 2022, was coached by Roly Crichton. She trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nPascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley.\nAt the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal.\nFollowing the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming. In February 2012, Pascoe became the inaugural winner of the Disabled Sportsperson of the Year award at the 2011 Halberg Awards.\nAt the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe competed in six events – the four in which she won medals at the 2008 Paralympics, plus the 50m freestyle (S10) and 100m freestyle (SM10) events. She successfully defended her 200 m individual medley (SM10) gold medal, breaking her own world record by four seconds with a time of 2:25.65.

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

Since 2018 he has led the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz after having led the Institute of Bioinformatics from 2006 to 2018. In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nStarner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled \"Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,\" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.\n\n\n=== Wearable computing ===\nStarner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed \"The Lizzy\", based on designs of the wearable \"hip PC\" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.\nSome of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a compute...

        "context": "Author: H. Eugene Stanley\nAffiliation: Boston University\nNumerical metrics:\n- hIndex: 133\n- i10Index: 637\n- Authors_Cited by count: 89568\n- Authors_Works count: 1094\n- Two-year mean citedness: 3.4680850505828857422\n\nInstitution: Boston University\nType: education\nLocation: US\nNumerical metrics:\n- Institution_Cited by count: 9090937\n- Institution_Works count: 220242\nHomepage: http://www.bu.edu/\n\nAdditional information: Harry Eugene Stanley (born March 28, 1941) is an American physicist and University Professor at Boston University. He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129.

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith between 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 until 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode, airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and Emmerdale's longest running character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014, with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. \nDuring his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adoptive brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009.\nThe character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had a sexual affair with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beaten up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the \"Who Shot Robert Sugden?\" storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both being exposed.\nFollowing his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences.\nDuring this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that (allegedly) results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to her son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out t..."

After completing his education at the University of Cambridge (BA, MMath, PhD), he spent the 1980s at Acorn Computers, where he was a principal designer of the BBC Micro and the ARM 32-bit RISC microprocessor. As of 2023, over 250 billion ARM chips have been manufactured, powering much of the world's mobile computing and embedded systems, everything from sensors to smartphones to servers.\nIn 1990, he moved to Manchester to lead research into asynchronous circuits, low-power electronics and neural engineering, where the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker) project is delivering a computer incorporating a million ARM processors optimised for computational neuroscience.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFurber was educated at Manchester Grammar School and represented the UK in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hungary in 1970 winning a bronze medal. He went on to study the Mathematical Tripos as an undergraduate student of St John's College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Mathematics (MMath – Part III of the Mathematical Tripos) degrees. In 1978, he was appointed a Rolls-Royce research fellow in aerodynamics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was awarded a PhD in 1980 for research on the fluid dynamics of the Weis-Fogh mechanism supervised by John Ffowcs Williams. During his PhD in the late 1970s, Furber worked on a voluntary basis for Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry within the fledging Acorn Computers (originally the Cambridge Processor Unit), on a number of projects; notably a microprocessor based fruit machine controller, and the Proton – the initial prototype version of what was to become the BBC Micro, in support of Acorn's tender for the BBC Computer Literacy Project.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nIn 1981, following the completion of his PhD and the award of the BBC contract to Acorn computers, Furber joined Acorn where he was a Hardware Designer and then Design Manager. He was involved in the final design and production of the BBC Micro and later, the Acorn Electron, and the ARM microprocessor. In August 1990 he moved to the University of Manchester to become the International Computers Limited (ICL) Professor of Computer Engineering and established the AMULET microprocessor research group.\nFurber's main research interests are in neural networks, networks on chip and microprocessors. In 2003, Furber was a member of the EPSRC research cluster in biologically inspired novel computation. On 16 September 2004, he gave a speech on Hardware Implementations of Large-scale Neural Networks as part of the initiation activities of the Alan Turing Institute.\nFurber's most recent project SpiNNaker, is an attempt to build a new kind of computer that directly mimics the workings of the human brain. Spinnaker is an artificial neural network realised in hardware, a massively parallel processing system eventually designed to incorporate a million ARM processors. The finished Spinnaker will model 1 per cent of the human brain's capability, or around 1 billion neurons.  The Spinnaker project aims amongst other things to investigate:\n\nHow can massively parallel computing resources accelerate our understanding of brain function?\nHow can our growing understanding of brain function point the w..."

He is the director of the Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).\n\n\n== Life ==\nAndreas Engel studied medicine and philosophy at Saarland University, Homburg, at the Technical University of Munich, and at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. After his medical exams (German Staatsexamen), he received his Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) from the Technical University Munich in 1987. \nIn 1987–1995 Engel was a post-doctoral fellow with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, Frankfurt, Germany. From 1996-2000, Engel headed a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research which was funded by the Heisenberg Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Between fall 1997 and summer 1998, he also was affiliated as a Daimler-Benz Fellow to the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. \nFrom 2000-2002, he worked at the Jülich Research Centre as head of the Cellular Neurobiology Group at the Institute for Medicine. In 2002, he was appointed to the Chair of Neurophysiology at the UKE. Engel is a member of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Hamburg. Since 2011, he is the coordinator of Collaborative Research Centre SFB 936 \"Multi-Site Communication in the Brain\" (with C. Gerloff, Dept. of Neurology, UKE).\n\n\n== Research ==\nAndreas Engel has become known by his work on the so-called \"binding problem\". His research focuses on the hypothesis that temporal synchrony serves for dynamic coordination of signals in the brain. In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications.\nAs a postdoctoral researcher with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.\nIn addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling.\nIn the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing, attention, working memory, decision-making and consciousness.\nRecent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration. The group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation. \nEngel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action. A major focus of his work are the implications of the studies on neural synchrony for un..."

He obtained his bachelor's degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1987, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1991. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, he was with the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Laboratories. His research has included formal modeling and analysis of reactive systems, hybrid systems, model checking, software verification, design automation for embedded software, and program synthesis. He is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and has served as the chair of ACM SIGBED (Special Interest Group on Embedded Systems). He holds the title of Zisman Family Professor at UPenn since 2003.\n\nOver the past thirty years, Alur has introduced several novel models of computation that provide the theoretical foundations for analysis, design, synthesis, and verification of computer systems. While rooted in algorithms and logic, his research, with over 52,000 citations, has found applications in control theory, cyber-physical systems, multi-agent systems, and program synthesis. The specific contributions listed below are highlights of his high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science, for which he is recognized with the 2024 Knuth Prize.\nTimed Automata: Classical model checking was developed for the analysis of finite-state discrete systems. In a ground breaking paper in ICALP 1991, Alur and Dill introduced an extension of automata with continuous timers. They proposed an algorithm to analyze the resulting infinite-state systems by introducing a novel notion of time-abstract bisimulation for algorithmic construction of finite-state quotients. This framework of timed automata has become the standard formal model for real-time systems inspiring a lot of research in specification logics, verification algorithms, formal language theory, and control theory. Problems such as \"does a communication protocol deadlock?\" and \"synthesize the most general controller to maintain safety\", in the presence of timing constraints, can be formulated and solved using decision problems on timed automata. These algorithms have been implemented in many tools and applied to debugging real-world examples. Their work on timed automata is one of the most highly cited papers in theoretical computer science: the TCS’95 journal version has now over 10K citations. For this work, Alur and Dill were awarded the inaugural Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) award in 2008 and the inaugural Alonzo Church Award for outstanding contributions in logic and computation in 2016.\nReal-time Temporal Logics: A related line of research concerns extensions of temporal logics to specify real-time requirements. This work provides a foundational study of different variants based on the modalities used (branching time versus linear-time), the underlying semantics for time (dense versus discrete), and the primitives allowed in syntax for expressing timing constraints. In a sequence of papers, Alur and coauthors identified the syntactic and semantic restrictions necessary for decidability and developed optimal model-checking algorithms wheneve..."

His major contribution to science are in the areas of cell motility and division and innovations in cell imaging.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMogilner was born in the Soviet Union on May 22, 1962.  He received his doctorate in physics in 1990 at the Ural Division of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in his hometown of Ekaterinburg.\nAfter two years of research at the University of Manitoba, he returned to graduate school at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and received his Ph.D in applied mathematics, a program that combined math and biology. His current work is in computational biology, which combines chemistry, biology, math and physics.\n\n\n== Research and Innovations ==\nOne of Mogilner's research topics is the mitotic spindle and how it is assembled. The mitotic spindle is what pulls conjoined chromosomes apart during cell division.\nMogilner hypothesized that the chromosomes were surrounded by proteins that directed the microtubules toward them. A few years after, research in Germany confirmed his prediction. His key papers on the subject have been cited hundreds of times; the most cited one, in Biophysical Journal has been cited 614 times by October 2014.\nHe is an Associate Editor at the Journal of Cell Biology and Bulletin of Mathematical Biology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1]\nChoi, Colin K.; Vicente-Manzanares, Miguel; Zareno, Jessica; Whitmore, Leanna A.; Mogilner, Alex; Horwitz, Alan Rick (2008). \"Actin and α-actinin orchestrate the assembly and maturation of nascent adhesions in a myosin II motor-independent manner\".

Initially the project had defined four goals:\n\nprovides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,\ndefines the meaning of each term (aka semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as possible\nimplements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable TOVE to automatically deduce the answer to many \"common sense\" questions about the enterprise, and\ndefines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical context.\nThe TOVE framework wants to support reasoning about enterprises, and therefore \"provides a characterisation of classes of enterprises by sets of assumptions over their processes, goals, and organization constraints.\" It has been further developed in the fields of concurrent engineering, supply chain management and business process re-engineering.\n\n\n=== Enterprise modeling ===\nIn the 1995 seminal article \"Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies\" (1995) Grüninger and Fox outline the definition and scope of enterprise modelling, stating:\n\nIn enterprise modelling, we want to define the actions performed within an enterprise, and define constraints for plans and schedules which are constructed to satisfy the goals of the enterprise.

It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (s, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (c, = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (Φ, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (w). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\", for example   \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for   S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            \n                              |\n                            \n                            \n                              \n                                |\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    NCS 1950\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Standard\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n    ...

He was with Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, Colorado, for almost 21 years, where he is a Professor Emeritus. He was elevated to Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  for applications of artificial intelligence in control of power electronics systems.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSimões was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 1963, to José L.G. Simões and Cecília A.B.G. Simões, with a sister, Maysa A.G. Simões. When he was 11 years old, he had a strong motivation and decided to become an electrical engineer when his cousin, Hélio Adauto de Paula, showed him vacuum tube radios, transistorized audio amplifiers, and took Simões to visit his work as an electrical machine designer in Equacional, a motor manufacturing company in the city of São Paulo.\nSimões was enrolled in an evening Catholic high school from 1978 to 1980, \"Liceu Coração de Jesus\", where he learned electronics as part of a technician degree. At that time, there was a job market for electronic technicians in Brazil, but he wanted to study further, and become an engineer. Therefore, in 1980, Simões took the entrance exams (FUVEST) for the University of São Paulo (USP) and was admitted as a student in \"Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (EPUSP)\". He completed his B.Sc. degree in 1985. In 1982 he was admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of EPUSP and started an internship at FDTE - Fundação para o Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Engenharia. From 1984 to 1985, he focused his expertise in telecommunications, antennas, high frequency, analog, and digital circuits design. His Senior Design in 1985 was a modem with analog and digital circuits implemented for interfacing an 8085 microprocessor, operating on a regular telephone connection. Such a system was made before the age of computers connected on telephone lines via modems. During his four years internship for FDTE, he was learning with senior engineers how to design DC-DC converters and off-line switching mode power supplies, using Phillips manuals for TV flyback circuits and National Instruments handbooks. Those power converters were built and implemented in railroad automation (FEPASA), as well as in the São Paulo Metro subway system. In 1985 Simões graduated from EPUSP and worked as an engineer for a few years with FDTE. He was inspired by several faculty from EPUSP, for example, Prof. Luiz de Queiroz Orsini who taught him modern computer-based electrical and electronics circuits analysis (that time with mainframes, and later on MAC's and PC's), José Roberto Cardoso who taught electrical machines and energy conversion. Simões also learned a lot from Prof. Edson Benedicto Ramos Féris and Prof. Guido Stolfi techniques for analog high-frequency circuit designer. During the Senior year (1985) Simões attended a course from Prof. Waldir Pó on introduction to Power Electronics, where the principles of utilizing thyristors, diodes, and transistors, to control electrical circuits for energy conversion was a transformation in how Simões wanted to further his career, giving him a strong motivation to learn and understand power electronics for controlling machines, ac-dc, dc-ac, and dc-dc power conversion.\nFrom 1986 to 1989, Simões worked for FDTE, at the same time leading technical research with three other partners wh..."

He regularly teaches undergraduate courses in applied linear algebra and machine learning. During his time at Stanford, he has been recognized with several teaching awards, including the 2016 Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the school's highest teaching honor. He was awarded the 2017 IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal, in recognition of his efforts in education in the theory and application of optimization, which has sparked the writing of improved linear algebra and convex optimization textbooks. He has served as director of Stanford's Information Systems Laboratory, and as a visiting professor at universities including City University of Hong Kong, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. While at Stanford, he has consulted with numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, and founded one. His groups' CVXGEN software is used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to guide their autonomous precision landing.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nBoyd's primary research interests are convex optimization, especially applications in control, signal processing, machine learning, and finance. His PhD dissertation was on Volterra series descriptions of nonlinear circuits and devices. His primary focus then turned to automatic control systems, where he focused on applying convex optimization, specifically linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), to a variety of control system analysis and synthesis problems.\nWith Craig Barratt, he authored Linear Controller Design: Limits of Performance in 1991. In 1994, Boyd and Laurent El Ghaoui, Eric Feron, and Ragu Balakrishnan authored the book Linear Matrix Inequalities in System & Control Theory. Around 1999, he and Lieven Vandenberghe developed a PhD-level course and wrote the book Convex Optimization to introduce and apply convex optimization to other fields.\nIn 2005 he and Michael Grant developed the MATLAB open source software package CVX, which makes it easy to specify and solve convex optimization problems. This work earned them the 2012 Beale-Orchard-Hays Prize for Excellence in Computational Mathematical Programming. In 2012 he and Jacob Mattingley developed CVXGEN, which generates fast custo..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

He is the director of the Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).\n\n\n== Life ==\nAndreas Engel studied medicine and philosophy at Saarland University, Homburg, at the Technical University of Munich, and at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. After his medical exams (German Staatsexamen), he received his Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) from the Technical University Munich in 1987. \nIn 1987–1995 Engel was a post-doctoral fellow with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, Frankfurt, Germany. From 1996-2000, Engel headed a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research which was funded by the Heisenberg Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Between fall 1997 and summer 1998, he also was affiliated as a Daimler-Benz Fellow to the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. \nFrom 2000-2002, he worked at the Jülich Research Centre as head of the Cellular Neurobiology Group at the Institute for Medicine. In 2002, he was appointed to the Chair of Neurophysiology at the UKE. Engel is a member of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Hamburg. Since 2011, he is the coordinator of Collaborative Research Centre SFB 936 \"Multi-Site Communication in the Brain\" (with C. Gerloff, Dept. of Neurology, UKE).\n\n\n== Research ==\nAndreas Engel has become known by his work on the so-called \"binding problem\". His research focuses on the hypothesis that temporal synchrony serves for dynamic coordination of signals in the brain. In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications.\nAs a postdoctoral researcher with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.\nIn addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling.\nIn the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing, attention, working memory, decision-making and consciousness.\nRecent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration. The group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation. \nEngel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action. A major focus of his work are the implications of the studies on neural synchrony for un..."

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory.\nLasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\"\nHer specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIrena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nAfter receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of.\n\n\n== Areas of Study in Applied Mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Optimization ===\nOptimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions.\nThe work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations.\n\n\n=== Control theory ===\nControl Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\"\nIn simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal..."

He is also an entrepreneur, a professor emeritus with the University of California, Davis, founder of the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), and former president, CEO, and chief scientist of this firm for 25 years (1986 to 2011) prior to sale of its IP to Lockheed Martin.\nGardner has authored four advanced-level engineering books on statistical signal processing theory including Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Nonprobabilistic Theory, 1987, which has been cited over 1200 times in peer-reviewed journal articles. Gardner's approach in this book is considered to be in keeping with the work of Norbert Wiener in his classic treatise Generalized Harmonic Analysis first published in 1930.\nIn the literature, Gardner is referred to as an influential pioneer of cyclostationarity theory and methodology, on the basis of his being a contributor of seminal advances. Gardner has written more than 100 peer-reviewed original-research articles. His research papers and books have been cited in seventeen thousand peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGardner married Nancy Susan Lenhart in June 1966 and the following year completed his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology while employed as a member of technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1967 to 1969, and completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Massachusetts under the supervision of Lewis E. Franks in 1972, at which time he joined the University of California, Davis as an Assistant Professor.\nGardner performed research and teaching there for nearly 30 years, becoming Professor Emeritus in 2001 and returning as Research Professor in 2023. In 1982, while at University of California, Gardner founded the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), an engineering research services company working primarily with the national security sector but also the cellular RF communications industry. He served as the president, CEO, and chief scientist of SSPI for 25 years. He also founded several entrepreneurial ventures during the latter 15 years of that period, including Gardner Technologies in 2001 for which he served as IP inventor and chief technology officer for five years.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAfter completing his Ph.D. dissertation entitled \"Representation and Estimation of Cyclostationary Processes,\" in 1972, Gardner began working on developing a new theory for the class of cyclostationary and polycyclostationary random processes.\nIn 1985, he wrote his first book, Introduction to Random Processes with Applications to Signals and Systems, which focused on the duality between the stochastic theory based on mathematical expectation and the nonstochastic (non-population) theory based on time averaging, which theory he was developing. Amir Atiya wrote \"The book is an excellent introduction to the theory of random processes...

As the political conflict in Argentina increased, Dahl attended graduate school in  France. In 1977, she was the first graduate at the Université d'Aix-Marseille to receive a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile involved in the research for her doctorate, Dahl became a pioneer in the field of logic programming, developing both the first logic programming database system, and an (also logic-programmed) front end to consult it in a human language (Spanish). Dahl's research and methodologies became multi-disciplinary including Computational Linguistics, Computational Molecular Biology, and Artificial Intelligence. She became an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1991. In 1996 she was honoured by the Logic Programming Association as one of the 15 founders of the Logic Programming Field, and has extensively pioneered as well the areas of Logic Grammars and Constraint Handling Rules.\nDahl is a woman pioneer in a male-dominated field. She fought gender inequality while she was a professor at Simon Fraser University, both through mentoring and role modelling, and through concrete actions. After Simon Fraser University refused to reimburse her $17 for childcare expenses while she was delivering a guest speech in Victoria, where she’d traveled with her nursing baby, she went first to her department and then Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) with her protest, which ended with the NSERC changing their policy to make childcare a covered expense for nursing researchers they funded. She proposed and actively promoted the provision of childcare at logic programming conferences, until it was adopted formally into their constitution, and is now routinely offered as a result. She also obtained a change in SFU's legislation when it resulted in her graduate student being timed out for delays caused by life-threatening medical conditions upon birthing twins.\nShe has developed numerous international research projects and collaborations, most notably with Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France, and worked with IBM, Vancouver Software Labs, International Artificial Intelligence. In her work with IBM, she obtained a record-breaking research contract. She served as president of the Association of Logic Programming from 2001-2005. She was awarded the prestigious Marie Curie Chair of Excellence 2008-2011 from the European Commission for her pioneering work on Constraint Solving and Language Processing for Bioinformatics. In 2012 she quit her Full Professor position at Simon Fraser University in order to focus on research. SFU awarded her Lifetime Professor Emerits status as from 2013.  Her research program continues under NSERC funding, as well as through her own AI company, Regenerative AI, and she serves at the Scientific Advisory Board of IMDEA Software. She balances her scientific activities with artistic ones, as a student of music, theatre and dance, and performs regularly as singer and guitarist in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Research ==\nDahl's research is focused on \"bridging the gap between the formal and the humanistic sciences, and to achieve more human-like communication with c..."

Practically at the midpoint of the Iberian Peninsula's Atlantic coast, it is located at the mouth of the Mondego River, 40 km (25 mi) west of Coimbra and sheltered by hills (Serra da Boa Viagem), sharing about the same latitude with Philadelphia, Baku and Beijing. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 62,125, in an area of 379.05 km2 (146.35 sq mi). The city of Figueira da Foz proper has a population of 46,600. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.\nIt is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a tourism city, it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest casinos of the Iberian Peninsula – the Casino Figueira.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the legend, the place's name is due to a fig tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. Foz means \"place of discharge\", often used at the point a river meets another body of water, specially where there is a clear energy or water flow clash. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the Neolithic age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this, an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. Julião, to the cathedral Sé Velha of Coimbra.\nKnowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role in the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the shipbuilding and cod drying industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to vila (small town) on 12 March 1771 and turned city (cidade) on 20 September 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained a great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Portuguese nickname of Rainha das Praias (Queen of the Beaches).\nThe municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of Buarcos, the Serra da Boa Viagem – a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside promenade paved with typical Portuguese pavement. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with the archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the Santa Catarina Fort and the old Buarcos Fortress, the Relógio Tower by the main sandy beach, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of Abadias.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Navigator, formerly and still commonly known as Soporcel, and Celbi, part of Altri) and glass (Verallia, part of Saint-Gobain). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries. Until the turn of the 21st century, a factory of the CIMPOR Group was installed in the Mondeg..."

Turkel (hebrew  אלי טורקל) (born January 22, 1944) is an Israeli applied mathematician and currently an emeritus professor of applied mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Tel Aviv University. He is known for his contributions to numerical analysis of Partial Differential equations particularly in the fields of computational fluid dynamics, computational electromagnetics, acoustics, elasticity and image processing with applications to first Temple ostraca and recently deep earning for forward and inverse problems in PDEs,\n\n\n== Research ==\nHis research interests include algorithms solving partial differential equations (PDEs) including scattering and inverse scattering, image processing, and crack propagation. His most quoted paper is with Jameson and Schmidt (JST) on a Runge-Kutta scheme to solve the Euler equations.  \nAnother main contribution includes fast algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations based on preconditioning techniques, radiation boundary conditions and high order accuracy for wave propagation in general shaped domains using difference potentials. \nHe has published work on reading ostraca from the first Temple period. Algorithmic handwriting analysis of Judah’s military correspondence sheds light on the composition of biblical texts, which appeared in PNAS was quoted by numerous sources including the front page of the NY Times. Later articles deal with ostraca at both Samaria and Arad. Other research includes high order compact numerical methods for hyperbolic equations, including the Helmholtz equation, acoustics and Maxwell's equations, using Cartesian grids but general shaped boundaries and interfaces. Other research uses deep learning to detect sources and obstacles underwater using the acoustic wave equation and data at a few noisy sensors. Recent applications of deep learning include using large time steps and improving the accuracy of finite differences for high frequencies on coarse grids. Other deep learning algorithms include, HINTS for iterative methods, VITO for inverse problems and MATCH for time-dependent PDEs. \nHe has also authored articles in Tradition and the Journal of Contemporary Halacha.\nTurkel was listed as an ISI highly cited researcher in mathematics. Google Scholar lists over 20,000 citations.\n\n\n== Education ==\nTurkel was born in New York City, United States. He received his B.A. degree from the Yeshiva University in 1965, M.S. degree from the New York University in 1967, and Ph.D. degree from the Courant Institute at New York University in 1970; all in mathematics.

He has worked in both the United States and Australia, and is currently based at the University of Bristol, UK, where he is the chair of cognitive psychology at the School of Psychological Science. His research, which originally pertained to computer simulations of people's decision-making processes, recently has focused on the public's understanding of science and why people often embrace beliefs that are sharply at odds with scientific evidence.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nLewandowsky received his bachelor's degree from Washington College in 1980, followed by an M.A. in 1981 and a PhD in 1985, both from the University of Toronto. He served as an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1994, and as associate professor for one year after that. In 1995, he joined the University of Western Australia, where he became the Winthrop Professor of Psychology in 2000. He remained there until April 2013, when he joined the University of Bristol. In 2014, he was named the first Digital Content Editor at the Psychonomic Society.\nIn 2015, Lewandowsky was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Correction of misinformation ===\nLewandowsky has published a number of studies examining people's belief in misinformation. In 2005, he was the lead author of a study which investigated people's beliefs in assertions about the Iraq War that had been retracted officially, and which examined people's beliefs about these assertions in Australia, the United States, and Germany. He and his co-authors found that American participants in the study persisted in believing the assertions even after being informed that they had been retracted. Lewandowsky told the Wall Street Journal that the original misinformation already had become a part of the Americans' mental worldview by the time it was retracted. He also noted that \"People who were not suspicious of the motives behind the war continued to rely on misinformation.\" In 2012, Lewandowsky published an article in Psychological Science in the Public Interest which examined the literature on misinformation and efforts to correct it. He found a considerable amount of speculation but little concrete research into the area.\nWith John Cook, Lewandowsky wrote \"The Debunking Handbook\", a review of research on debunking falsehoods and a guide to better practices for doing so. Much of \"The Debunking Handbook\" focuses on \"backfire effects\", whereby telling people that they are wrong often reinforces their prior beliefs, rather than weakening them. An updated Debunking Handbook 2020 tries to represent the consensus of the field.\n\n\n=== Climate change and conspiracy theories ===\nIn 2012, Lewandowsky put forward what would later become one of his best-known studies regarding public opinion on climate change. The survey examined data from more than 1,000 readers of climate science blogs, taken from online questionnaires posted there. Lewandowsky approached five climate sceptic blogs to ask them to post the questionnaire, but they all declined to do so. The study was accepted by Psychological Science on 7 July 2012, and published in the May 2013 issue of the journal with the title, \"NASA Faked the Moon Landing—Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\". Based on a survey of visitors to global warming related blogs, Lewandowsky and his two co-authors concluded that belief in free-market econom..."

        "context": "Gernot Heiser (born 1957) is a Scientia Professor and  the John Lions Chair for operating systems at UNSW Sydney, where he leads the Trustworthy Systems group (TS). \n\n\n== Life ==\nIn 1991, Heiser joined the School of Computer Science and Engineering of UNSW Sydney, originally as a lecturer, reaching the rank of full professor in 2002, a position he retains to date. \nAlso in 2002 he joined the newly created research organisation NICTA as one of its initial Program Leaders, in charge of the Embedded, Real-Time and Operating Systems (ERTOS) program. After a re-organisation in 2011 ERTOS became the Software Systems Research Group (SSRG) which he led. When NICTA was absorbed into CSIRO in 2016, Heiser stepped back from management of the group, which was then called Trustworthy Systems (TS).  In 2021 CSIRO abandoned TS, at which time Heiser took the group back to UNSW and re-assumed its leadership.\nSince April 2020, Heiser serves as the Founding Chairman of the seL4 Foundation.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHeiser's research focuses on microkernels, microkernel-based systems, and virtual machines, and emphasizes performance and reliability.\nHis group produced Mungi, a single address space operating system,\nfor clusters of 64-bit computers, and implementations of the L4 microkernel with very fast inter-process communication.\nHis Gelato@UNSW team was a founding member of the Gelato Federation, and focused on performance and scalability of Linux on Itanium. They established theoretical and practical performance limits of message passing inter-process communication (IPC) on Itanium.\nAfter joining NICTA at its creation in 2002, his research shifted away from high-end computing platforms, and toward embedded systems, with the aim of improving security, safety, and reliability via use of microkernel technology.\nThis led to the development of a new microkernel, called seL4, and its formal verification, claimed to be the first-ever complete proof of the functional correctness of a general-purpose OS kernel.\nHis work on virtualization was motivated by the need to provide a complete OS environment on his microkernels. His Wombat project followed the approach taken with the L4Linux project at Dresden, but was a multi-architecture paravirtualized Linux running on x86, ARM and MIPS hardware. The Wombat work later formed the basis for the OKL4 hypervisor of his company Open Kernel Labs (OK Labs).\nThe desire to reduce the engineering effort of paravirtualization led to the development of the soft layering approach of automated paravirtulization which was demonstrated on x86 and Itanium hardware.\nHis work on virtual non-uniform memory access (vNUMA) demonstrated a hypervisor which presents a distributed system as a shared-memory multiprocessor as a possible model for many-core chips with large numbers of processor cores.\nDevice drivers are another focus of his work, including the first demonstration of user-mode drivers with a performance overhead of less than 10%,\nan approach to driver development that eliminates most typical driver bugs by design,\ndevice drivers produced from device test benches,\nand a demonstration of the feasibility of generating device drivers automatically from formal specifications.\nHe also conducted research on operating-system-level energy management.\nSince leaving OK Labs in 2010 he focussed almost exclusively on seL4 and high-assurance seL4-based systems, both in research and in technology transfer. Notable research achievements include sound and complete worst-case execution-time (WCET) analysis of seL4, claimed to be the first ever such analysis for a protected-mode OS kernel.\nHis work on extending seL4’s functionality to support mixed-criticality systems (MCS) led to making time a first-class resource in seL4’s capability system.\nFocussing on microarchitectural timing channels, he demonstrated in 2015 the first practical cross-core timing side channel attack.\nThis led to work on the systematic prevention of timing-channel leakage, and the proposal of a set of mechanisms for achieving this, collectively referred as time protection.\nIn the past, he also worked on semiconductor device simulation, where he pioneered use of multi-dimensional modeling to optimize silicon-based solar cells.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nGerman National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (Leopoldina) (Member) (2023)\nThe Royal Society of New South Wales (RSN) (Fellow) (2022)\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM) Distinguished Speaker (2021)\nACM SIGOPS Together with his co-authors (he was 3rd author) Heiser received the Hall of Fame Award (2019), for the paper \"seL4: Formal Verification of an OS Kernel\" \nAustralian Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE) Fellow (2016)\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow (2016) \"For contributions to security and safety of operating systems\" \nAustralian Computer Society (ACS) ICT Researcher of the Year (2015)\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM) Fellow (2014) \"For contributions demonstrating that provably correct operating systems are feasible and suitable for real-world use\" \nScientia Professor of the University of New South Wales\n2010 Innovation Hero of The Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering at the University of Sydney\nNSW Scientist of the Year 2009 Category Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences\nBest Paper at the 22nd ACM SIGOPS Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, 2009\nBest Paper at the 13th IEEE Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference, 2008\nBest Student Paper at the 2005 USENIX Annual Technical Conference\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGernot Heiser's blog\nBio at UNSW with full publication list"

        "context": "Scott Elliott Fahlman (born March 21, 1948) is an American computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute and Computer Science Department.  He is notable for early work on automated planning and scheduling in a blocks world, on semantic networks, on neural networks (especially the cascade correlation algorithm), on the programming languages Dylan, and Common Lisp (especially CMU Common Lisp), and he was one of the founders of Lucid Inc. During the period when it was standardized, he was recognized as \"the leader of Common Lisp.\" From 2006 to 2015, Fahlman was engaged in developing a knowledge base named Scone, based in part on his thesis work on the NETL Semantic Network. He also is credited with coining the use of the emoticon.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nFahlman was born in Medina, Ohio, the son of Lorna May (Dean) and John Emil Fahlman. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degree in electrical engineering and computer science in 1973, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in artificial intelligence in 1977. He has noted that his doctoral diploma says the degree was awarded for \"original research as demonstrated by a thesis in the field of Artificial Intelligence\" and suggested that it may be the first doctorate to use that term. He is a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.\nFahlman acted as thesis advisor for Donald Cohen, David B. McDonald, David S. Touretzky, Skef Wholey, Justin Boyan, Michael Witbrock, and Alicia Tribble Sagae.\nFrom May 1996 to July 2001, Fahlman directed the Justsystem Pittsburgh Research Center.\n\n\n=== Emoticons ===\nFahlman was not the first to suggest the concept of the emoticon – a similar concept for a marker appeared in an article of Reader's Digest in May 1967, although that idea was never put into practice.\n\nIn an interview printed in The New York Times in 1969, Vladimir Nabokov noted: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile –\n some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.\"\nFahlman is credited with originating the first smiley emoticon, which he thought would help people on a message board at Carnegie Mellon to distinguish serious posts from jokes. He proposed the use of :-) and :-( for this purpose, and the symbols caught on. The original message from which these symbols originated was posted on 19 September 1982. The message was recovered by Jeff Baird on 10 September 2002 and read:\n\n19-Sep-82 11:44    Scott E  Fahlman             :-)\nFrom: Scott E  Fahlman <Fahlman at Cmu-20c>\n\nI propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:\n\n:-)\n\nRead it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark\nthings that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use\n\n:-(\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

Eldar (Hebrew: יונינה חנה אלדר; born 25 January 1973) is an Israeli professor of electrical engineering at the Weizmann Institute of Science, known for her pioneering work on sub-Nyquist sampling.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEldar was born in Toronto, Canada. She is the third daughter of Rabbi Meyer and Vicky Berglas. She moved with her family to Israel in 1979. \nShe received her B.Sc. degrees in physics and electrical engineering both from Tel Aviv University (TAU), Israel, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.\nHer Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science was received from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2002. Eldar authored the thesis Quantum Signal Processing under the supervision of Alan V. Oppenheim. Her postdoctoral research was completed in 2002 at the Digital Signal Processing Group at MIT.\n\n\n== Career ==\nEldar moved back to Israel in 2002 and became a senior lecturer in the Electrical Engineering Department at the Technion, Haifa. In 2005 she became an associate professor at that department, and in 2010, a full  professor, holding the Edwards Chair in Engineering.\nFrom March 2019 Eldar is a  professor in the Math and Computer Science Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot.\nShe is also a visiting professor at MIT and a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute, and was a visiting professor at Stanford University. She is also an adjunct professor at Duke University.\nEldar is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, an IEEE Fellow and a EURASIP \nFellow.\n\n\n== Work ==\nHer research interests include sampling methods and A/D design, compressed sensing, detection and estimation theory, optimization for signal processing, medical imaging, signal processing and optimization for communication systems, signal and image processing for optics, deep learning and graphs, computational biology.\nUpon receiving the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award (2016), her research work and its implications were described by the award committee:\n\nYonina Eldar’s pioneering work on sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction of sparse analog signals has demonstrated the potential to improve radar, medical imaging, communication, and storage systems. Bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications, Eldar developed the concept of “Xampling” for sub-Nyquist sampling and built hardware prototypes to demonstrate how the technique works in practical settings. The ability to sample signals at rates significantly lower than the standard Nyquist rate, but without the distortion normally associated with such techniques, positively impacts power consumption, storage memory, size, and digital signal processing rates in analog-to-digital converters. Eldar’s innovations will enable portable ultrasound machines for emergency and rural medicine, radar systems with improved resolution, and better wireless capabilities for cognitive (intelligent) radio transmission and reception.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nEldar is the author of the book Sampling Theory: Beyond Bandlimited Systems (2015) and co-author of Compressed Sensing (2012) and Convex Optimization Methods in Signal Processing and Communications (2010),\nall published by Cambridge University Press.\nShe has more than 300 published journal articles and has registered more than 20 patents.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nEldar has received dozens of awards for excellence in research and teaching, including the IEEE Signal Processing Society Technical Achievement Award (2013),\nthe IEEE/AESS Fred Nathanson Memorial Radar Award (2014), and the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award (2016).

        "context": "Roelf Johannes (Roel) Wieringa (born 1952) is a Dutch computer scientist who was a professor of Information Systems at the University of Twente, specialized in the \"integration of formal and informal specification and design techniques\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWieringa received his MSc in 1978 at the University of Groningen, Faculty of Mathematics, for the thesis \"Generatieve Grammatika's en Bijbehorende Analyseprocedures voor Natuurlijke talen\" (Generative Grammars and Their Analysis procedures for NaturalLanguages\". He received his MA in 1987 at the University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Philosophy for the thesis Machine intelligence and Explication, and his PhD in 1990 at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, under supervision of Reinder Pieter van de Riet for the thesis Algebraic Foundations for Dynamic Conceptual Models.\nAfter finishing his PhD, he continued to work at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Vrije Universiteit. In 1998 he joined the Department of Computer Science of the University of Twente as Professor of Information Systems. From 2006 to 2011 he was Scientific Director of the School of Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS), and from 2009 to 2012 he headed the computer science department at the University of Twente.\nCirca 1996, Wieringa and Frank Dehne wrote the Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling, for Wieringa's conceptual modeling courses and book, Requirements Engineering: Frameworks for Understanding.\nWieringa has been Associate Editor in Chief of the IEEE Software journal from 2004 to 2007, and was member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Business Information Systems, the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling, and the Requirements Engineering Journal.\nIn 2019, Wieringa retired from academia, and now works and blogs at The Value Engineers, which was founded in 2017 with Jaap Gordijn and Dan Ionita.\n\n\n== The engineering cycle ==\n\nThe engineering cycle is a framework used in Design Science for Information Systems and Software Engineering, proposed by Roel Wieringa in his book \"Design Science Methodology for Information Systems and Software Engineering\".\nThe engineering cycle consists of:\n\nProblem investigation.\nTreatment design.\nTreatment validation.\nTreatment implementation.\nImplementation evaluation.\nThe design cycle consists of the first 3 tasks of the engineering cycle: investigation, design, and validation.\nThe engineering and design cycles do not prescribe a mandatory, rigid sequence of activities. Moreover, they are often applied recursively for sub-problems of the main research objective.\nThe engineering cycle and the design cycle are often applied in several iterations (hence “cycle”). In such a case, the evaluation may become the investigation part of the next engineering cycle.\n\n\n=== Validation vs. evaluation in the engineering cycle ===\nAccording to the Design science methodology of (Wieringa, 2014), validation is part of the design cycle. It involves checking if the designed artifacts support the initial assumptions. It is executed in a theoretical, “laboratory” environment; such as through discussions and interviews with practitioners and experts. Validation is executed before the implementation in practice.\nOn the other hand, evaluation is executed after the implementation in practice of the designs. It involves analyzing the behavior, effects, and impact of the designed artifacts in practice, in the field. In our case, this meant implementation and analysis of the designs in actual, industry IT projects.\nStefan Morcov proposes a parallel between these 2 activities and a similar framework, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) model. The TRL model was proposed by NASA and is currently also widely applied in the European Union's research programs such as Horizon. Thus, validation leads to TRL level 4 - “Technology validated in a laboratory environment”; while evaluation leads to a TRL level 6 - “Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment”.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nBooks, a selection\n\n1990.

After that film, she worked as a producer and creative director at the New York design firm R/GA Interactive. While there, she created games and interactive products, including Sony's Multiplayer Jeopardy! and Multiplayer Wheel of Fortune and MSN's NetWits, an early multiplayer casual game launched in 1996. Starting in 1998, she was president and co-founder of the interactive television game developer, Spiderdance, Inc. Spiderdance's games included NBC's Weakest Link, MTV's webRIOT, The WB's No Boundaries, History Channel's History IQ, Sony Game Show Network's Inquizition and TBS's Cyber Bond.\nIn 2004, Fullerton joined the faculty at the University of Southern California, as an Assistant Professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, Interactive Media Division. There, she became the co-director of the USC Game Innovation Lab. She also published her first book, Game Design Workshop, in 2004. In 2008, Fullerton became the Electronic Arts Endowed Chair of Interactive Entertainment at USC. From 2010 to 2017, she served as Chair of the USC Interactive Media & Games Division. In 2014 she was named Director of the USC Games Program, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the School of Cinematic Arts and the Viterbi School of Engineering at USC. \nFullerton served as a faculty advisor for the award-winning student games Cloud (2005) and flOw (2006). She also contributed to Reality Ends Here, a pervasive game which ran at USC from 2011 to 2014. She was a game designer for The Night Journey (2007-2018), a game/art project in production with media artist Bill Viola, and Participation Nation (2008), a game to teach Constitutional history produced in collaboration with KCET and Activision. \nFullerton's work has received numerous industry honors including an Emmy nomination for interactive television, best Family/Board Game from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, I.D.

It puts Thoreau's ideas about life into playable form. The game exemplifies Fullerton's design methods, where she encourages designers to find inspiration in ideas and activities that have meaning to them and then see where that leads rather than rely on standard genres and design solutions. The project was supported by a media arts grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, one of the first video game projects to be awarded such a grant, as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities. Walden, a game was released on Itch.io on July 4, 2017 and subsequently named Game of the Year and Most Significant Impact at the 2017 Games for Change awards.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nFullerton, Tracy.

In 1989 he was visiting researcher at the Université Catholique de Louvain, and in 1990/91 visiting researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Back in Rotterdam in 2001 Wagelmans was appointed Professor of Operations Research at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, where he held his inauguration speech \"Moeilijk doen als het ook makkelijk kan\" (Making it hard, when it can be done easily) about the usefulness of mathematical analysis in decision problems. In 2005, he was appointed Professor of Management Science.\nFrom 1999 to 2003 Wagelmans was director of the Rotterdam Institute for Business Economic Studies (RIBES), and associate director of the Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM). From 2001 to 2006 he was Director of the Bachelor-Master Program in Econometrics & Management Science, and from 2005 to 2006 also Director of the Bachelor-Master Program in Informatics & Economics. From 2006 to 2014 Wagelmans was Director of the Econometric Institute as successor of Philip Hans Franses, and is succeeded by Patrick Groenen. He is research fellow of the Tinbergen Institute since 1999, and fellow of ERIM since 2006.\nSince 2015 Wagelmans is Chairman of the Dutch Society of Operations Research (NGB), and since 2016 he is Vice President 1 of the Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO).\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== A Dynamic Lot-Sizing Model with Demand Time Windows, 2001 ===\nIn the 2001 article \"A Dynamic Lot-Sizing Model with Demand Time Windows\" published in Management Science, Lee, Sila & Wagelmans described the dynamic lot-sizing model and \"the dynamic lot-sizing problem with demand time windows and provides polynomial time algorithms for computing its solution.\" They summarized this matter as follows:\n\nOne of the basic assumptions of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that the aggregate demand of a given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but can be delivered later at the expense of a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real life applications, the customer offers a grace period - we call it a demand time window - during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window.\nJaruphongsa summarized that \"Lee et al. (2001) generalize the classical (single echelon) dynamic lot-sizing model to consider demand time windows, and they provide polynomial time algorithms for two cases—where backorders are allowed and where they are not.\"\n\n\n=== Multiple-Depot Integrated Vehicle and Crew Scheduling, 2004 ===\nIn the 2005 article \"Multiple-Depot Integrated Vehicle and Crew Scheduling,\" Huisman, Freling and Wagelmans presented two new models and algorithms in the field of the vehicle routing problem, specifically for \"integrated vehicle and crew scheduling in the multiple-depot case.\" they explained: \n\nThe algorithms are both based on a combination of column generation and Lagrangian relaxation. Furthermore, we compare those integrated approaches with each other and with the traditional sequential one on random generated as well as real-world data instances for a suburban/extra-urban mass transit system. To simulate such a transit system, we propose a new way of generating randomly data instances such that their properties are the same as for our real-world instances.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nWagelmans has authored and co-authored numerous publications.

In 2017 he became the head of the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) AI Lab. Hochreiter is also a founding director of the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. Hochreiter and his collaborators have applied PSVM to feature selection, including gene selection for microarray data.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHochreiter was awarded the IEEE CIS Neural Networks Pioneer Prize in 2021 for his work on LSTM.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Page Sepp Hochreiter\nSepp Hochreiter at the Mathematics Genealogy Project..."

Nakhleh (Arabic): لؤي نخله; born May 8, 1974) is a Palestinian-Israeli-American computer scientist and computational biologist who is the William and Stephanie Sick Dean of the George R. Brown School of Engineering, a professor of Computer Science and a professor of BioSciences at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNakhleh was born on May 8, 1974, to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds both U.S. and Israeli citizenship.\nNakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. Tandy Warnow, in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, and became a Full Professor in 2016.  He served as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science from July 2018 until December 2020. Nakhleh served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Rice University from 2017 to 2020.\nIn addition to his duties as the Dean of Engineering at Rice University, Nakhleh currently teaches courses in discrete mathematics and computational biology. Nakhleh has received high acclaim at Rice University for his skills in teaching, and he is the recipient of many awards in this area.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nNakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and comparative genomics under \nscenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious phylogenetic networks: networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to reticulate evolution. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) \nevolutionary history of the Indo-European languages. Their paper on perfect phylogenetic networks was included as one of the 20 best papers published in Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America, in the 30-year period 1986–2016.\nLater, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably incomplete lineage sorting. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies coalescent with gene flow.\nAdditionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics.\nNakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet, an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nNakhleh's honors and awards include:\n\nThe National Science Foundation CAREER Award, 2009.\nThe Sloan Fellowship in the Molecular Biology category, 2010.\nThe Guggenheim Fellowship in the Organismic Biology and Ecology category, 2012.\n\n\n== References ==..."

(1980) and Ph.D. (1984) in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Andrew Barto. His doctoral dissertation, Temporal Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning, introduced actor-critic architectures and temporal credit assignment.\nHe was influenced by Harry Klopf's work in the 1970s, which proposed that supervised learning is insufficient for AI or explaining intelligent behavior, and trial-and-error learning, driven by \"hedonic aspects of behavior\", is necessary. This focussed his interest to reinforcement learning.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1984, Sutton was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts.\nFrom 1985 to 1994, he was a principal member of technical staff in the Computer and Intelligent Systems Laboratory at GTE in Waltham, Massachusetts. After that, he spent 3 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a senior research scientist.\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Sutton worked at the AT&T Shannon Laboratory in Florham Park, New Jersey as principal technical staff member in the artificial intelligence department.\nSince 2003, he has been a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta. He led the institution's Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory until 2018.\nWhile retaining his professorship, Sutton joined Deepmind in June 2017 as a distinguished research scientist and co-founder of its Edmonton office.\nSutton became a Canadian citizen in 2015 and renounced his US citizenship in 2017.\nIn a 2019 essay, Sutton criticized the field of AI research for failing \"to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run\", arguing that \"70 years of AI research [had shown] that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin\", beating efforts building on human knowledge about specific fields like computer vision, speech recognition, chess or Go.\nIn 2023 he and John Carmack announced a partnership for the development of AGI.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nSutton, R.

        "context": "Sir David John Spiegelhalter  (born 16 August 1953) is a British statistician  and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. From 2007 to 2018 he was Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. Spiegelhalter is an ISI highly cited researcher. \nHe is currently Chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge. On 27 May 2020 he joined the board of the UK Statistics Authority as a non-executive director for a period of three years, a term which was extended through to 2026.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSpiegelhalter was born on 16 August 1953. He was educated at Barnstaple Grammar School, a state grammar school in Barnstaple, Devon, from 1963 to 1970. He then studied mathematics at Keble College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1974. He moved to University College London, where he gained his Master of Science (MSc) degree in statistics in 1975 and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in mathematical statistics in 1978. His doctoral thesis was titled \"Adaptive Inference Using Finite Mixture Models\", and was supervised by Adrian Smith.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSpiegelhalter was research assistant in Brunel University in 1976 and then visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, 1977–78. After his PhD, he was a research assistant for the Royal College of Physicians; he was based at the University of Nottingham, where his PhD supervisor, Adrian Smith, had been appointed a professor.\nFrom 1981 he was at the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge. He has been an honorary lecturer at the University of Hong Kong since 1991. He has also been a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and the World Anti-Doping Agency. He played a leading role in the public inquiries into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, the murders by Harold Shipman, the independent inquiry on Mid Staffs Trust and, more recently, the infected blood inquiry.\nBetween 2007 and 2012 he divided his work between the Cambridge Statistical Laboratory (three-fifths) and the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit (two-fifths). He left the MRC in March 2012 and worked full-time at the Statistical Laboratory as the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk until his retirement. He remained chair of the Winton Centre until it closed in 2023. As of 2012 Spiegelhalter has supervised 7 PhD students.\n\nIn 2012, Spiegelhalter hosted the BBC Four documentary Tails You Win: The Science of Chance which described the application of probability in everyday life. He also presented a 2013 Cambridge Science Festival talk, How to Spot a Shabby Statistic at the Babbage Lecture Theatre in Cambridge.\nHe was elected as President of the Royal Statistical Society, and took up the position on 1 January 2017. His Presidential address later that year took as its subject Trust in Numbers.\nIn March 2020 Spiegelhalter launched a podcast called Risky Talk where he interviews experts in risk and evidence communication on topics like genetics, nutrition, climate change and immigration. He appeared on BBC Desert Island Discs on 6 February 2022.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSpiegelhalter's research interests are in statistics including\n\nBayesian approach to clinical trials, expert systems and complex modelling and epidemiology.\nGraphical models of conditional independence. He wrote several papers in the 1980s that showed how probability could be incorporated into expert systems, a problem that seemed intractable at the time. Spiegelhalter showed that while frequentist probability did not lend itself to expert systems, Bayesian probability most certainly did.\nStatistical software. In the 1990s Spiegelhalter led the Medical Research Council team that developed WinBUGS (\"Bayesian analysis Using Gibbs Sampling\"), a statistical-modelling system allowing hierarchical prior distributions. WinBUGS and its successor OpenBUGS specifies graphical models using acyclic directed graphs whose nodes are random variables, which are updated using Gibbs sampling (an updating method for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation). Earlier Bayesian software had required that the probability distribution for the observed data be an exponential family and that the prior be its conjugate distribution. Allowing flexible choices of prior distributions simplified hierarchical modelling and helped to promote multilevel models, which became widely used in epidemiology and education.\nGeneral issues in clinical trials, including cluster randomisation, meta-analysis and ethical monitoring.\nMonitoring and comparing clinical and public-health outcomes and their associated publication as performance indicators.\nPublic understanding of risk, including promoting concepts such as the micromort (a one in a million chance of death) and microlife (a 30-minute reduction of life expectancy). Media reporting of statistics, risk and probability and the wider conception of uncertainty as going beyond what is measured to model uncertainty, the unknown and the unmeasurable.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n1975 Fellow, Royal Statistical Society\n1985 Guy Medal in Bronze, Royal Statistical Society\n1990 Award for Outstanding Statistical Application, American Statistical Association\n1993 Chartered Statistician, Royal Statistical Society\n1994 Guy Medal in Silver, Royal Statistical Society\n1994 Honorary Doctorate, Aalborg University, Denmark\n2005 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)\n2006 Appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to medical research\n2006 Appointed Honorary Professor of Biostatistics at University of Cambridge\n2009 Weldon Memorial Prize and Medal\n2010 Honorary Doctorate of Science, Plymouth University\n2013 Honorary Doctorate of Science, Bath University\n2013 Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University\n2014 Knighted in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to statistics\n2016 Honorary Fellow Institute and Faculty of Actuaries\n2020 Guy Medal in Gold, Royal Statistical Society\n2020 Michael Faraday Prize of the Royal Society\n2021 Honorary Fellow of the Market Research Society\n2023 Honorary Doctorate, Athens University of Economics and Business\n2023 Honorary Doctorate of Laws, Dundee University\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\nHorizon – To Infinity and Beyond (10 February 2010)\nThe Joy of Stats (7 December 2010)\nHorizon – What is One Degree?

        "context": "A Reeb graph (named after Georges Reeb by René Thom) is a mathematical object reflecting the evolution of the level sets of a real-valued function on a manifold.\nAccording to  a similar concept was introduced by G.M. Adelson-Velskii and A.S. Kronrod and applied to analysis of Hilbert's thirteenth problem. Proposed by G. Reeb as a tool in Morse theory, Reeb graphs are the natural tool to study multivalued functional relationships between 2D scalar fields \n  \n    \n      \n        ψ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\psi }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n arising from the conditions\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∇\n        ψ\n        =\n        λ\n        ∇\n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\psi =\\lambda \\nabla \\phi }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        ≠\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda \\neq 0}\n  \n, because these relationships are single-valued when restricted to a region associated with an individual edge of the Reeb graph. This general principle was first used to study neutral surfaces in oceanography.\nReeb graphs have also found a wide variety of applications in computational geometry and computer graphics, including computer aided geometric design, topology-based shape matching, topological data analysis, topological simplification and cleaning, surface segmentation  and parametrization, efficient computation of level sets, neuroscience, and geometrical thermodynamics.\nIn a special case of a function on a flat space (technically a simply connected domain), the Reeb graph forms a polytree and is also called a contour tree.\nLevel set graphs help statistical inference related to estimating probability density functions and regression functions, and they can be used in cluster analysis and function optimization, among other things. \n\n\n== Formal definition ==\nGiven a topological space X and a continuous function f: X → R, define an equivalence relation ~ on X where p~q whenever p and q belong to the same connected component of a single level set f−1(c) for some real c. The Reeb graph is the quotient space X /~ endowed with the quotient topology.\nGenerally, this quotient space does not have the structure of a finite graph. Even for a smooth function on a smooth manifold, the Reeb graph can be not one-dimensional and even non-Hausdorff space.\nIn fact, the compactness of the manifold is crucial: The Reeb graph of a smooth function on a closed manifold  is a one-dimensional Peano continuum that is homotopy equivalent to a finite graph.\nIn particular, the Reeb graph of a smooth function on a closed manifold with a finite number of critical values –which is the case of Morse functions, Morse–Bott functions or functions with isolated critical points – has the structure of a finite graph.\n\n\n== Structure of the Reeb graph defined by a smooth function ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        M\n        →\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:M\\to {\\mathbb {R} }}\n  \n be a smooth function on a closed manifold \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

        "context": "Martha Alice Hearst is a professor in the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. She did early work in corpus-based computational linguistics, including some of the first work in automating sentiment analysis, and word sense disambiguation. She invented an algorithm that became known as \"Hearst patterns\" which applies lexico-syntactic patterns to recognize hyponymy (ISA) relations with high accuracy in large text collections, including an early application of it to WordNet; this algorithm is widely used in commercial text mining applications including ontology learning. Hearst also developed early work in automatic segmentation of text into topical discourse boundaries, inventing a now well-known approach called TextTiling.\nHearst's research is on user interfaces for search engine technology and big data analytics. She did early work in user interfaces and information visualization for search user interfaces, inventing the TileBars query term visualization. Her Flamenco research project investigated and developed the now widely used faceted navigation approach for searching and browsing web sites and information collections. She wrote the first academic book on the topic of Search User Interfaces (Cambridge University Press, 2009).\nHearst is an Edge Foundation contributing author and a member of the Usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.\nHearst received her B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. in computer science, all from Berkeley. In 2013 she became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. She became a member of the CHI Academy in 2017, and has previously served as president of the Association for Computational Linguistics and on the advisory council of NSF's CISE Directorate. Additionally, she has been a member of the Web Board for CACM, the Usage Panel for the American Heritage Dictionary, the Edge.org panel of experts, the research staff at Xerox PARC, and the boards of ACM Transactions on the Web, Computational Linguistics, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, and IEEE Intelligent Systems.\nHearst has received an NSF CAREER award, an IBM Faculty Award, and an Okawa Foundation Fellowship. Her work on user interfaces has had a profound impact on the industry, earning Hearst two Google Research Awards and four Excellence in Teaching Awards.} She has also led projects worth over $3.5M in research grants.\nHearst’s publications date back to 1990, when ‘A Hybrid Approach to Restricted Text Interpretation’ was published in Stanford University’s AAAI Spring Symposium on Text Based Intelligent Systems in March of that year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeb page at UC Berkeley\nWebsite for Search User Interfaces book (text freely available and searchable)\nThe Flamenco Faceted Navigation and Search Project"

He is chairman of the Open Data Institute which he co-founded with Tim Berners-Lee. He is also a visiting professor in the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Shadbolt is an interdisciplinary researcher, policy expert and commentator. His research focuses on understanding how intelligent behaviour is embodied and emerges in humans, machines and, most recently, on the Web, and has made contributions to the fields of psychology, cognitive science, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, computer science and the emerging field of web science.\n\n\n== Education ==\nShadbolt was born in London but adopted and raised in the Derbyshire village of Ashford-in-the-Water, living a \"bucolic existence\" until he went to university. He went to Lady Manners School, then a state-funded grammar school. He obtained an undergraduate degree in philosophy and psychology from Newcastle University, then received his Ph.D.  from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. His thesis resulted in a framework for understanding how human dialogue is organised and was supervised by Barry Richards and Henry S. Thompson.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nShadbolt's research has been in Artificial Intelligence since the late 1970s working on a broad range of topics; from natural language understanding and robotics through to expert systems, computational neuroscience, memory through to the semantic web and linked data. He also writes on the wider implications of his research. One example is the book he co-authored with Kieron O'Hara that examines privacy and trust in the Digital Age – The Spy in the Coffee Machine. His most recent research is on the topic of social machines – understanding the emergent problem solving that arises from a combination of humans, computers and data at web scale. The SOCIAM project on social machines is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).\n\nIn 1983, Shadbolt moved to the University of Nottingham and joined the Department of Psychology.

        "context": "Paola Velardi (born in Rome, April 26, 1955) is a full professor of computer science at Sapienza University in Rome, Italy.  Her research encompasses Artificial Intelligence and specifically,  natural language processing, machine learning  business intelligence and semantic web. Velardi is one of the hundred female scientists included in the database \"100esperte.it\" (translated from Italian with \"100 female experts\"). This online, open database champions the recognition of top-rated female scientists in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas.\n\n\n== Research ==\nVelardi's research aims at using algorithms to analyse natural language on social networks and in general in natural language existing in any written documentation. Her current interest encompasses the study of social media for epidemiological surveillance, for the analysis of the leadership role of women working in enterprise social networks and for the design of recommender systems. Velardi also maintains a strong interest in the area of ontology learning and knowledge bases. A well-known example of application of her research is the extraction of trending topics on social media. The fundamental concepts of her research within the area of natural language are knowledge learning, graph mining and semantics. Velardi and her team developed a suit of web-based tools based on machine learning techniques that classify natural language for several purposes of analysis, whose applications stem from e-health to female leadership. The key purpose of these web-based tools is the extraction of taxonomies, ontologies and semantics from a pool of written natural-language data, including human crafted knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and from social, semantic and biological networks.\nAccording to Google Scholar bibliometrics updated until February 2023, Velardi's scientific publications have been cited more than 7118 times. Her h-index was 38. She has published more than 150 papers on international journals and conference proceedings. Some of her publications have been published in top rated journals such as Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics, Knowledge-Based Systems, IEEE Transactions on Data and Knowledge Engineering (TDKE), Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), on Computers (TOC), on Software Engineering (TSE), Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, and Journal of Web Semantics.\n\n\n== Education and previous employments ==\nVelardi graduated in electronic engineering from Sapienza University in 1978. From 1978 to 1983, she worked for the Ugo Bordoni Foundation, a research institution focusing on ICT and working under the supervision of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.  In 1983, she was a visiting scholar at Stanford University. During this period she became passionate about Artificial Intelligence, which will remain her area of research throughout her career. From 1984 to 1986, she came back to her natal city and worked as a researcher for IBM. From 1986 to 1996 she was an associate professor in the engineering faculty of Università Politecnica delle Marche in Italy. Starting in November 1996, she taught in and did research for the Department of Computer Science at the Sapienza University. Velardi was the head of Bachelor and Master Programs in Computer Science at Sapienza University from 2010 to 2013 and from 2015 to 2016.\n\n\n== Current employment ==\nSince November 2001, Velardi has been a full professor in the department of computer science (\"Dipartimento di Informatica\" in Italian) at Sapienza University in Rome, Italy.\nSince 2013, she has been the coordinator of the Distance Learning Degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nVelardi is one of the hundred female scientists included in the database \"100esperte.it\" (translated from Italian with \"100 female experts\"). This database lists top Italian female STEM scientists. Six out of one hundred scientists in the 100esperte's database are computer scientists like Velardi.\nVelardi is in the list of the top Italian scientists. A top scientist appearing in the Top-Italian-Scientists database is a scientist whose h-index is greater than 30.\nIn March 2017, she was given an IBM Faculty Award for her research on social recommender systems.\nIn December 2018, Velardi was included in the list of the 50 most influential Italian women in science and technology by Inspiring Fifty, a non-profit that aims to increase diversity in STEM by making female role models in tech more visible.\nIn September 2019 she was the local co-organizer and Program Chair of the 6th ACM Celebration of Women in Computing.\nIn November 2019 Velardi received the Standout Woman Award International at the seat of the Italian Parliament in Montecitorio.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nVelardi aims at debunking the myth of computer science as a man-oriented and \"inflexible\" discipline. She is the founder of the project \"NERD? Non e' roba per donne?\" (translated from Italian: \"NERD? Is it not stuff for women?\"). This project was launched by Velardi in 2012 in the Department of Computer Science at Sapienza University. Since 2013 the project has been carried out in partnership with IBM Italy, which later created a spin-off of the project. The goal of the project is two-fold: (1) conveying computer science as creative, interdisciplinary and problem-solving-oriented science, and (2) encouraging young female students in studying computer science by, for instance, developing apps for smartphones. She has been the program chair of the 19th ACM celebration of Women in Computing. She is the creator and coordinator of the G4GRETA,  an educational project that involves students of the third and fourth grades of Rome and Lazio. The project combines the development of IT skills with the themes of environmental sustainability and soft skills (teambuilding, pitching, social networking, etc.)\nVelardi is also involved in scientific dissemination. In 2020 and 2021 she cooperated with RaiCultura, the cultural division of RAI, the national broadcasting company.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPaola Velardi publications indexed by Google Scholar\nVelardi's profile in 100esperte.it's database (Italian)"

        "context": "Katy Börner (born 1967 in Leipzig, Germany) is an engineer, scholar, author, educator, and speaker specializing in data analysis and visualization, particularly in the areas of science and technology (S&T) studies and biomedical applications. Based out of Indiana University, Bloomington, Börner is the Victor Yngve Distinguished Professor of Engineering & Information Science in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering and the Department of Information and Library Science at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering and a member of the Core Cognitive Science Faculty. Since 2012, she has also held the position of visiting professor at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and in 2017-2019, she was a Humboldt Fellow at Dresden University of Technology, Germany.\nBörner is the founding director of the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center, an organization dedicated to the study, development, and promotion of tools and services for the analysis and visualization of large-scale networks, particularly in the areas of biomedical, social, and behavioral science, physics, and technology. She is also the curator of the international Places & Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit, a collection of science maps and macroscope tools that seeks to educate the general public about science mapping and empower individuals to create their own data visualizations.\nIn 2015, she was appointed to a two-year term as member of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Data Advisory Council. Since October 2018, she has served as a Trustee of the Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics (IPAM), NSF Math Institute at UCLA.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nBörner holds an MS in electrical engineering from the University of Technology in Leipzig and earned her PhD in computer science from the University of Kaiserslautern in 1997. After one year as a Postdoc at the University of Bielefeld, Börner joined the Faculty of Computer Science at Indiana University (IU), Bloomington in 1998 and later took up primary residence on the Faculty of Information and Library Science. In 2009, she was named Victor H. Yngve Professor in the School of Library and Information Science (now the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. In 2015, she was promoted to distinguished professor, the highest academic rank within IU.\n\n\n== Atlas Series ==\nBörner is widely known for her Atlas books. The first, Atlas of Science: Visualizing What We Know (2010), explains the purposes and practices of science mapping, providing readers with many illustrations of the power of maps to navigate, manage, and utilize knowledge spaces. The Atlas of Science won the 2011 Best Information Science Book award from the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) and garnered reviews in major magazines, with one reviewer writing that \"Börner's magnificent book offers provocative new maps of science that will inspire fresh thinking.\" The second book in the series, Atlas of Knowledge: Anyone Can Map (2015), introduces a theoretical visualization framework meant to guide readers through user and task analysis; data preparation, analysis, and visualization; visualization deployment; and the interpretation of science maps. Like its predecessor, the second Atlas was greeted enthusiastically, with one review claiming, \"[w]hether you read it cover to cover or just browse the extraordinary examples, you put it down inspired.\" Like its predecessor, the Atlas of Knowledge is abundantly illustrated, using many images from the Places & Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit. The final book in the Atlas trilogy, Atlas of Forecasts: Predicting and Implementing Desirable Futures, was published in 2021.\n\n\n== Creative works ==\nThroughout her career, Börner has worked with artists to bring STEM to different audiences. She has collaborated closely with comic artists, visual designers, game developers, pottery artists, and illustrators.\nIn 2007, she collaborated with Fileve Palmer and Elisha Hardy on \"Science Maps for Kids\", a hands-on activity that invites children to see, explore, and understand science from above. One map shows our world and the places where science is practiced or researched. The other shows major areas of science and their complex interrelationships. Children and adults alike are invited to help solve the puzzle by placing major scientists, inventors, and inventions in their appropriate places. \nDuring 2011-2013, Börner collaborated with visual artist Ying-Fang Shen on the short film Humanexus. Serving as producer, she wrote the initial story and provided guidance and resources. The final soundtrack was added by Norbert Herber, a senior lecturer at Indiana University's Media School. The film tells the story of human communication from the Stone Age to the present day and beyond. It aims to make tangible the enormous changes in the quantity and quality of our collective knowledge and the impact of different media and distribution systems on knowledge exchange. Humanexus won numerous awards around the globe, including Third Prize at the Aviff Cannes Art Film Festival, Best Original Screenplay (Animation) at the 2014 Unofficial Google+ Film Festival, Best Short Animation at the 2014 Albany FilmFest, the Award of Excellence at the 2014 Canada International Film Festival, and the Documentary Shorts Award and Best Director Award at the 2014 Macon Film Festival.\nIn 2015, Börner and artist Carrie Longley]collaborated on the creation of a 3-ft. tall clay sculpture that gives science a physical, three-dimensional form and invites playful interaction. The result, Sculptures of Science, makes the history of science tangible and lets visitors trace the evolution of scientific ideas back to their origins using marbles placed at the contemporary top level to observe intellectual journeys into the past.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2012, Börner was named an American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Fellow. In 2017, Börner became a Humboldt Fellow and collaborated with colleagues at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany. In 2018, Börner was elected as an ACM Fellow for \"contributions to methods and tools that enable users to render data into actionable insights.\" In 2019, Börner was honored with the inaugural Ada Lovelace Award by the city of Bloomington, Indiana, in recognition of her contributions to the fields of science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM).\n\n\n== Additional publications ==\nIn addition to the Atlas series, Börner has written more than 200 articles for academic journals and scholarly texts and has edited several publications.

With Dana Ballard, he proposed the predictive coding model of brain function in 1999. He has contributed to Bayesian models of perception and decision making. In brain-computer interfacing, Prof. Rao and his collaborators were the first to demonstrate direct brain control of a humanoid robot in 2007.\nIn the first demonstration of human brain-to-brain communication in August 2013, Rao wearing an electrical brain-signal reading cap triggered the movement of his colleague Andrea Stocco's hand via the Internet, allowing their brains to cooperate to solve a computer game. The demonstration was subsequently replicated across other pairs of humans, and extended to other tasks, and to a BrainNet for more than two brains. \nRao also works on the decipherment of the Indus script. By comparing the entropy of the Indus script with entropies of linguistic scripts such as those for Sumerian and Old Tamil, and nonlinguistic sequences such as DNA and a programming language, his work suggested that the Indus script behaves more like a linguistic script than nonlinguistic sequences.\nHe has also given a TED talk on this topic where he backed the Dravidian hypothesis put forward by Iravatham Mahadevan. \nRao is the author of the book Brain-Computer Interfacing (Cambridge University Press, 2013) and co-editor of two volumes, Probabilistic Models of the Brain (MIT Press, 2002) and Bayesian Brain (MIT Press, 2007).

He is primarily known for his contributions to numerical analysis and has authored over 200 papers in his area and published four books.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGautschi was born December 11, 1927, in Basel, Switzerland, to Heinrich Gautschi (1901-1975). His paternal family originally hailed from Reinach. His patrilineal uncle, Adolf Eduard Gautschi, was a custodian and landscape painter. He had one twin brother Werner (1927-1959). He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Basel on the thesis Analyse graphischer Integrationsmethoden advised by Alexander Ostrowski and Andreas Speiser (1953).\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince then, he did postdoctoral work as a Janggen-Pöhn Research, Fellow at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo in Rome (1954) and at the Harvard Computation Laboratory (1955). He had positions at the National Bureau of Standards (1956–59), the American University in Washington, D.C., the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1959–63) before joining Purdue University where he has worked from 1963 to 2000 and now being professor emeritus. He has been a Fulbright Scholar at the Technical University of Munich (1970) and held visiting appointments at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1976), Argonne National Laboratory, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,  ETH Zurich (1996-2001), the University of Padova (1997), and the University of Basel (2000).\nAs well-known (e.g. Gerhard Wanner, Geneva c. 2011 and the well-known first-hand sources and subsequent reports such as Math. Intelligencer, etc), one of Gautschi's most important contributions on numerical simulation of special functions offered evidence and confidence to de Branges's tour-de-force attack on the elusive Bieberbach conjecture on the magnitude of coefficients of schlicht functions, which hitherto received only slow, difficult and partial progress by work of Bieberbach, Loewner, Gabaredian and Schiffer. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1960, Gautschi married Erika, who was previously married to his twin brother Werner (1927-1959). Werner was also an academic professor and lecturer and emigrated to the United States with his wife in 1956. After his sudden death, Erika returned to Switzerland, while being pregnant with her child to Basel where she met Walter and married him in 1960. They had three daughters;\n\nTheresa (1961-2018), married Ainsworth, two children; Emily Ainsworth (b. 1994) and Keith (b. 1997), formerly of Camas, Washington.\nDoris (b. 1965)\nCaroline Cari (b. 1969)\nThrough his predeceased twin brother, he has stepson/nephew, Thomas (b. 1960).

        "context": "Peter James Denning (born January 6, 1942) is an American computer scientist and writer. He is best known for pioneering work in virtual memory, especially for inventing the working-set model for program behavior, which addressed thrashing in operating systems and became the reference standard for all memory management policies.  He is also known for his works on principles of operating systems, operational analysis of queueing network systems, design and implementation of CSNET, the ACM digital library, and codifying the great principles of computing. He has written numerous influential articles and books, including an overview of fundamental computer science principles, computational thinking, and his thoughts on innovation as a set of learnable practices.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDenning was born January 6, 1942, in Queens, New York, and raised in Darien, Connecticut. He took an early interest in science, pursuing astronomy, botany, radio, and electronics while in grade school.  At Fairfield Prep, he submitted home-designed computers to the science fair in 1958, 1959, and 1960.  His second computer, which solved linear equations using pinball machine parts, won the grand prize.\nHe attended Manhattan College for a Bachelor in EE (1964) and then MIT for a PhD (1968).  At MIT he worked on Project MAC and contributed to the design of the pioneering Multics operating system.  His PhD thesis, \"Resource allocation in multiprocess computer systems\", introduced seminal ideas in working sets, locality, thrashing, and system balance.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nAt Princeton University from 1968 to 1972, Denning wrote his classic book, Operating Systems Theory (1973), with E G Coffman.  He collaborated with Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman on optimality proofs for paging algorithms, and on a simple proof that compilers based on precedence parsing do not need to backtrack. At Purdue University (1972–1983) he supervised numerous PhD theses validating locality-based theories of memory management and extending the new mathematics of operational analysis of queueing networks.  He co-founded CSNET.  He became department head in 1979 and completed another book on computational models, Machines, Languages, and Computation, with Jack Dennis and Joe Qualitz.\nAt NASA Ames from 1983 to 1991, he founded the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) and turned it into one of the first centers for interdisciplinary research in computational and space science.\nAt George Mason University from 1991 to 2002 he headed the Computer Science Department, was an associate dean and vice provost, and founded the Center for the New Engineer.  The Center was a pioneer in web-based learning. He created a design course for engineers, called Sense 21, which was the basis of his project to understand innovation as a skill.  He created a course on Core of Information Technology, the basis of his Great Principles of Computing project.\nAt Naval Postgraduate School since 2002, he heads the Computer Science Department, and directs the Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority.  He chaired the faculty council.\nDenning has served continuously as a volunteer in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since 1967. In that time, he served as president, vice president, three board chairs, Member-at-Large, Editor of ACM Computing Surveys, and Editor of the monthly ACM Communications.  He received seven ACM awards for service, technical contribution, and education.  ACM presented him with a special award in June 2007 recognizing 40 years of continuous service.\nDenning has received 26 awards for service and technical contributions.  These include one quality customer service award, three professional society fellowships, three honorary degrees, six awards for technical contribution, six for distinguished service, and seven for education.\nDenning's career has been a search for fundamental principles in multiple subfields of computing. He writes prolifically. From 1980 to 1982 he wrote 24 columns as ACM President, focusing on technical and political issues of the field.  From 1985 to 1993 he wrote 47 columns on \"The Science of Computing\" for \nAmerican Scientist magazine, focusing on scientific principles from across the field. Beginning in 2001 he has written quarterly \"IT Profession\" columns for Communications of the ACM, focusing on principles of value to practicing professionals.\n\n\n=== Virtual memory ===\nIn 1970 he published a classic paper that displayed a scientific framework for virtual memory and the validating scientific evidence, putting to rest a controversy over virtual memory stability and performance.\nIn 1966 he proposed the working set as a dynamic measure of memory demand, and explained why it functioned using the locality idea introduced by Les Belady of IBM.  His working set paper became a classic. It received an ACM Best paper award in 1968 and a SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award  in 2005.\n\n\n=== Operating system principles ===\nIn the early 1970s he collaborated with Ed Coffman Jr., on Operating Systems Theory, which became a classic textbook used in graduate courses and stayed in print until 1995.  That book helped to erase doubts that the OS field could be approached as a science.\nIn the middle 1970s he collaborated with Jeffrey Buzen on operational analysis, extending Buzen's basic operational laws to deal with all queueing networks.  The operational framework explained why computer performance models work so well, even though violating the traditional stochastic Markovian assumptions.  It has become the preferred method for teaching performance prediction in computing courses.\nIn the early 1980s, he was one of the four founding principal investigators of the Computer Science Network (CSNET), sponsored by the National Science Foundation  The other three were Dave Farber, Larry Landweber, and Tony Hearn.  They led the development of a fully self-supporting CS community network that by 1986 included 165 sites and 50,000 users.  CSNET was the key transitional stepping stone from the original ARPANET to the NSFNET and then the Internet.   In 2009, the Internet Society awarded CSNET its prestigious Jon Postel award, recognizing its key role in bridging from the ARPANET to NSFNET.\nDenning led the ACM Digital Library project 1992-97, which went live in 1997.  The Association for Computing Machinery became the first professional society to offer a fully searchable library of everything it ever published.\n\n\n=== Great Principles of Computing ===\nIn 1999, Denning expanded the search for fundamental principles to cover all of computing.  The discovery of natural information processes in biology, physics, economics, materials, and other fields convinced him that the basic definitions of computation had to be modified to encompass natural information processes as well as artificial.  He and his team have produced a draft framework.\nThe Great Principles framework revealed that \"innovating\" is a core practice of computing.  Unable to find anyone who understood how to teach the skill of innovating, he joined with Bob Dunham and identified eight foundational practices of innovation.  In 2011, they published The Innovator's Way, a book laying the eight essential practices of successful innovation.\nIn 2015, he and Craig H. Martell co-authored Great Principles of Computing, a slim volume which summarizes computer science principles which are fundamental to all technologies, in a form accessible to computer science students as well as those seeking a readable overview of the field.\nIn 2019, he and Matti Tedre published Computational Thinking as part of the \"MIT Press Essential Knowledge\" series of concise books, providing an overview of what computational thinking is, and its applications in scientific thought and investigation.\n\n\n=== Computing education ===\nDenning has been a major influence in computing education.  In the early 1970s he led a task force that designed the first core course on operating systems (OS) principles. OS became the first CS core course which was not focused on pure mathematical theory, though it still used math freely as needed.  In the mid-1980s he led a joint ACM/IEEE committee that described computing as a discipline with nine core functional areas and three cognitive processes, the basis of ACM Curriculum 1991.  In the 1990s, he set out on a quest to codify the great principles of computing.\nDenning maintains that computing is a science both of natural and artificial information processes.  NSF designated him a Distinguished Education Fellow in 2007 to launch a movement to use the Great Principles framework for innovations in education and research.  In 2009, ACM's SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) recognized his contributions with its lifetime service award.\n\n\n=== Humor ===\nDenning is an inveterate punster who frequently uses humor to get points across. Examples:\n\nApril Fool special section (when he was editor), ACM Communications (April 1984)\nOn Active and Passive Writing, a treatise exhorting students to write in the active voice\nA Tale of Two Islands is a fable about a controversy in queueing theory over operational analysis, first published in 1991. Contained as an appendix to a 2006 overview of operational analysis\n\n\n=== Quotes ===\nComputation is the principle; the computer is the tool.\nAll speech is free.  It's just the consequences that get you.\nA request is not in the words you speak.  It is in the listening of those who hear you.\nThose who have devoted many years trying to make computers behave like brains have succeeded mainly in cultivating brains that think like computers!\nLocality is a principle of nature.  Caching works because our brains organize information by localities.\nInnovation is not brilliant new ideas; it is new practice adopted by a community.\nSolidarity, not software, generates collaboration.\n\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nDenning is the author or editor of 340 technical papers and eleven books.

        "answer": "2005",
        "context": "Dean Forrest Sittig (born March 2, 1961) is an American biomedical informatician specializing in clinical informatics. He is a professor in Biomedical Informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Executive Director of the Clinical Informatics Research Collaborative (CIRCLE). Sittig was elected as a fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 1992, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society in 2011, and was a founding member of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics in 2017. Since 2004, he has worked with Joan S. Ash, a professor at Oregon Health & Science University to interview several Pioneers in Medical Informatics, including G. Octo Barnett, MD, Morris F. Collen, MD, Donald E. Detmer, MD, Donald A. B. Lindberg, MD, Nina W. Matheson, ML, DSc, Clement J. McDonald, MD, and Homer R. Warner, MD, PhD.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSittig earned a bachelor's degree in science and a master's degree in biomedical engineering before he trained in medical informatics at the University of Utah School of Medicine and the LDS Hospital under Reed M. Gardner and Homer R. Warner. His dissertation was entitled, “COMPAS: A Computerized Patient Advice System to Direct Ventilatory Care.\" He won the 1987 Martin Epstein Award at the Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (now the American Medical Informatics Association) for this work.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHis research focuses on understanding the sociotechnical risks of, and solutions to address, unintended consequences associated with design, development, implementation, and use of various health information technologies (HIT), including computer-based provider order entry, clinical decision support within electronic health records (EHRs), and most recently in EHR-related patient safety. Along with Hardeep Singh, he developed an “8-dimension socio-technical model for safe and effective HIT implementation and use”. A modification of the model was used by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), in a sentinel event report from the Joint Commission, and the National Quality Forum to describe the socio-technical challenges associated with measuring HIT safety. This model has also been used in a variety of HIT-related research studies including: identification of keys to implementing novel clinical prediction algorithms, exploring barriers to implementation of clinical information systems in nursing homes, development of a childhood cancer passport for care, and development of a questionnaire regarding EHR-related safety concerns.\nSittig has published over 600 scientific articles and 6 books. (h-index = 82).\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nIn 1992 he was elected a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI). In 2017 he was elected an Inaugural Fellow of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI). In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA).

        "answer": "2001",
        "context": "Adam N. Joinson (born 1970) is a British author, academic and public speaker within the area of cyberpsychology. He is Professor of Information Systems at University of Bath, following posts at the University of West of England and the Open University. and has conducted ground breaking research into the psychology of Internet usage.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nJoinson studied for his undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of London, Goldsmiths College in 1991. He then went to the University of Hertfordshire to obtain his PhD in Social Psychology in 1996.\nHe has written a number of books, journal articles and proceedings that discuss major themes of psychology such as Social Penetration Theory, Cognitive Dissonance and Expectancy violations theory. The titles of these books include \"Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour\". He has also edited \"The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology\". He is a Programme Director of research on 'Understanding and Countering Online Behaviour' at the Centre for Research on Security Threats.\n\n\n== Areas of Research ==\nJoinson's research interests are focused on the interactions between people and technology. In particular, the nature of communication via technology, and the ways in which system design influences communication.\n\n\n=== Findings ===\nIn 2000, Joinson and his team of scientists carried out a groundbreaking study which looked into the psychological consequences of e-mail communication. He asked 100 pairs of students (who did not know each other) to resolve a dilemma, either face-to-face or via e-mail. When presenting the team's findings at the British Psychological Society's London conference, Joinson stated that the participants \"disclosed over four times as much when they communicated over the Internet as when they talked face-to-face\". The study concluded that \"e-mailing strips away inhibitions because it changes the rues of normal communications\". However, with the addition of web cams to the study, the number of disclosures dropped immediately. This suggested that the use of e-mail gives a sense of \"distance, anonymity and privacy\".\nIn 2007, a project led by Joinson, Privacy and Self-Disclosure Online discovered that users who had previously demonstrated a high level of caution regarding online privacy would accept losses to their privacy if they trusted the recipient of their personal information. Out of all the participants studied, 56 per cent of Internet users stated that they had concerns about privacy when they were online. Joinson concluded the project by stating \"one of the most interesting aspects of our findings, is that even people who genuinely have a high level of concern regarding privacy online may act in a way that is contrary to their stated attitudes when they come across a particular set of conditions\".\nIn an interview with Interattivo in 2008, Joinson stated the findings of a study into the social networking site of Facebook and how the general public used it. His study included: \"...two parts. In the first, 137 users were asked what they used Facebook for, what they most enjoyed about using the site, and what uses were most important to them. These responses were then clustered by trained raters. Selected answers from each cluster were then turned into a questionnaire that 241 people completed, and statistical techniques used to identify activities that occurred together.......A number of surprising findings emerged. First, the amount of time people spend on the site is predicted not by their number of friends, but by the amount they interact with the applications within Facebook. In fact, spending time interacting with applications was associated with having fewer friends on Facebook. Second, the majority of the respondents had changed their privacy settings, but some had made themselves more open, which was motivated by a desire to meet new people – so they made themselves 'discoverable'. Third, the frequency of visits to the site was motivated by an interest in photographs and in other people's news (via their 'status' updates)\".\nIn 2010, Joinson spoke with The Daily Telegraph about his belief that social media may have negative effects on privacy and intimacy levels between people. He stated \"as new technology and social media encourage sharing of the small details of everyday life, it also reduces privacy in social relationships, and may have negative effects on intimacy levels between people. If you desire intimacy, it may well be disastrous to add your partner to Facebook, or to follow them on Twitter\".\n\n\n=== Media Interviews ===\nIn 2002, a survey conducted by search engine AltaVista found that 80% of men claimed to be better surfers than their female partners. Joinson, asked by the BBC, suggested the findings bear out traditional gender stereotypes. He stated \"as information has become such a valuable commodity, it's not surprising that men have transferred their traditional hunter-gatherer role to hunting for information on the web\". Joinson however suggests that he would be \"surprised if men's self-perceived superiority is grounded in fact\".\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJoinson has published over 60 journal articles, and has released three books:\n\nUnderstanding the Psychology of Internet Behavior (2003) (ISBN 0333984684)\nThe Oxford handbook of Internet psychology (2007) (ISBN 019956180X)\nTruth, Lies and Trust on the Internet (2009) (ISBN 184169584X)\n\n\n=== Papers ===\nJoinson AN, Reips U.-D., Buchanan TB, & Paine-Schofield CB (2011) Privacy, Trust and Self-Disclosure Online Human-Computer Interaction 25(1): 1-24DOI: 10.1080/07370020903586662\nVasalou, A., Joinson A.M.& Courvoisier D.

He is married with two children.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nThompson attended the Hull Grammar School, and studied Mechanical Sciences at Cambridge University (Clare College, 1955–61), winning the three top prizes of the Engineering Faculty: the Rex Moir Prize for Part I of the Tripos, the Archibald Denny Prize for Part II, and the John Winbolt Prize for a research essay. His doctoral thesis (PhD, 1962) under the supervision of (Lord) Henry Chilver was devoted to the buckling of thin spherical shells. He spent three more years at Cambridge as a research fellow at Peterhouse.\nHe joined the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University College London (UCL) in 1964, where he was professor from 1977-2002. Here he built up an internationally recognized group in structural stability, organized an IUTAM (International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics) Symposium  and wrote an authoritative book on the underlying general theory. Two more books on the buckling of engineering structures quickly followed  and he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1985.\nHis research interests were shifting to dynamics and his book Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos (1986) sold 14,000 copies and had a major world-wide impact by introducing recent mathematical developments to engineers and applied scientists. His research activity in this period included the discovery of chaos in impacting system, and the establishment of a new design criterion for the integrity of systems against basin erosion by incursive fractals.\nAs a senior fellow of the UK Science and Engineering Research Council (1988–93) he was the founder and director of the UCL Centre for Nonlinear Dynamics and its Applications (1991-2002) which was renowned for its application of advanced mathematics to practical problems in (for example) off-shore engineering. The centre hosted an IUTAM Symposium  in 1993, and Thompson was for 10 years (1998-2007) a vigorous and innovative editor of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, the world’s longest running scientific journal. His later research developed the static-dynamic analogy, delineating spatial chaos in twisted rods and buckling cylinders; together with some ideas regarding climate change.\nA workshop in Thompson's honour was held at UCL in April, 2003. The proceedings, published in the journal Nonlinear Dynamics  included a biographical article by Lord Chilver. Later, for his 75th birthday, a special issue of Phil. Trans. R. Soc. was edited by Isaac Elishakoff, for which Thompson wrote a paper offering advice to young researchers.\n\n\n== Appointments ==\nFulbright Research Associate, Dept.

He then held appointments as a visiting researcher at the University of Sydney in 1994, and as a researcher at the University of Karlsruhe in 1993. From 1997 till 2000, he was a BISC Research Fellow and lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2003, he is a full professor, and chair for bioinformatics and information mining at Konstanz University, Germany. In 2017 he took a leave of absence to become full-time CEO at KNIME AG, Zurich, Switzerland.\nAt IEEE, Berthold served as a president of the IEEE System, Man, and Cybernetics Society from 2010 till 2011.\n\n\n== Research ==\nBerthold has focused his research on large, and heterogeneous data sources, with particular focus on methods from AI (rule learning, neural networks, fuzzy logic and general machine learning).\n\n\n=== Fuzzy models ===\nBerthold has published on methods to extract fuzzy models from data based on constructive methods to build probabilistic neural networks. He developed similar algorithms for the extraction of fuzzy rule models. He then extended those models beyond classification and invented algorithms to extract regression models, so-called fuzzy graphs from data automatically.\n\n\n=== Bisociative knowledge discovery ===\nAt Konstanz University, Berthold initiated a European project (EU FP7 BISON) that focused on bisociative methods to create insights from diverse data sources. The consortium created output summarized in the resulting edited volume Bisociative Knowledge Discovery.\n\n\n=== Widening of machine learning algorithms ===\nBerthold was the first to introduce the idea of widened machine learning which draws on parallel resources to improve model accuracy rather than the usual focus on speed-up. He discussed a number of generic ways of tuning data mining algorithms while providing a series of experiments. Later on, he conducted an in-depth analysis of the concept of Widened Data Mining, which aims at reducing the impact of heuristics by exploring more than just one suitable solution at each step.\nIn 2017, Berthold and his team proposed the bucket selector, a model-independent randomized selection strategy, with the capability to perform better than existing selection strategies in cases without a diversity measure.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2001 – KS Fu Award, North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society\n2010 – Fellow, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\n2011 – honorary professor, Óbuda University, Budapest\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nAdvances in Intelligent Data Analysis – Reasoning about Data (1997) ISBN 9783540408130\nIntelligent Data Analysis 2nd Edition (2007) 9783540430605\nBisociative Knowledge Discovery (2012) ISBN 9783642318306\nGuide To Intelligent Data Science (2020) ISBN 9783030455736\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nBerthold, M., & Diamond, J.

In the words of the prize committee: \"This paper has had a major impact on distributed message-passing algorithms. It focused a spotlight on the notion of locality in distributed computation and raised interesting questions concerning the locality level of various distributed problems, in terms of their time complexity on different classes of networks. Towards that goal, in this paper, Linial developed a model particularly suitable for studying locality, which ignores message sizes, asynchrony and failures. This clean model allowed researchers to isolate the effects of locality and study the roles of distances and neighborhoods, as graph theoretic notions, and their interrelations with algorithmic and complexity-theoretic problems in distributed computing.\"\nBorodin, Allan; Linial, Nathan; Saks, Michael E.

This paper on competitive analysis of online algorithms studies metrical task systems, a very general model of tasks where decisions on how to service a sequence of requests must be made without knowledge of future requests. It introduces the metrical task system model, describes how to use it to model various scheduling problems, and develops an algorithm that in many situations can be shown to perform optimally.\nLinial, Nathan; Mansour, Yishay; Nisan, Noam (1993), \"Constant depth circuits, Fourier transform, and learnability\", J.

        "answer": "1998",
        "context": "Nicola Guarino (born 1954, in Messina) is an Italian computer scientist and researcher in the area of Formal Ontology for Information Systems, and the head of the Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA), part of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Trento.\n\n\n== Work ==\nGuarino's research interests are in the area of Artificial Intelligence, predominantly in Knowledge Representation. He may be best known in the Computer Science community for developing OntoClean, the first methodology for formal ontological analysis, with his colleague Chris Welty.\n\n\n=== Knowledge Representation ===\nHe is arguably one of the founders of the field of ontology in computer science, but undoubtedly one of its most outspoken proponents.  While most of the AI and KR researchers focused on reasoning algorithms and semantics of representation languages, and considered the actual knowledge expressed in these languages and reasoned over by these algorithms to be unimportant (just examples), Guarino spearheaded a counter-movement to study how knowledge should be expressed.  The rallying cry of this movement undoubted came from the well-known \"Naive Physics Manifesto\" paper by Patrick J. Hayes.\n\n\n=== Knowledge-based systems ===\nGuarino's work in the early 1990s began to take shape as he applied his engineering background to understand how knowledge-based systems were built and, most importantly, how the knowledge was acquired.  He was a familiar face in the early Knowledge Acquisition Workshops where he was best known for pointing to himself and saying, \"I am not a class!\" This remark referred to what Guarino believes to be an important and fundamental distinction between universals and particulars.  While some representation systems allow classes to themselves be instances of other classes, and in certain contexts that makes sense, there are some instances which can never be classes (these are particulars).\n\n\n=== Formal Ontology in Information Systems conference ===\nHis emphasis on formal rigor in specifying the type of knowledge that was eventually to be called \"ontologies\" by computer scientists, led him to the field of formal ontology in philosophy, where he began to study the metaphysics literature, focusing on the work of such notables as Quine, Strawson, and especially Simons.\nGuarino founded the Formal Ontology in Information Systems conference in 1998, a recurring academic conference focused on ontologies themselves, not the languages they are represented in.  He has worked tirelessly to promote research in ontology and maintain a level of scientific rigor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFaculty Homepage"

        "context": "Natasha Fridman Noy is a Russian-born American Research scientist who works at Google Research in Mountain View, CA, who focuses on making structured data more accessible and usable.  She is the team leader for Dataset Search, a web-based search engine for all datasets. Natasha worked at Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research before joining Google, where she made significant contributions to ontology building and alignment, as well as collaborative ontology engineering. Natasha is on the Editorial Boards of many Semantic Web and Information Systems publications and is the Immediate Past President of the Semantic Web Science Association. From 2011 to 2017, she was the president of the Semantic Web Science Association.\n\n\n== Education ==\nNatasha Noy earned a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Moscow State University, a master's degree in computer science from Boston University and a doctorate from Northeastern University. Her thesis focused on knowledge-rich documents, in particular information retrieval for scientific articles.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nNoy moved from Northeastern to Stanford University, to work with Mark Musen on the Protégé ontology editor as a postdoctoral researcher, and later as a research scientist. It was here that she completed her important work on Prompt, an environment for automated ontology alignment, which was published in 2002.  For recognizing the specifics of the problem and providing an inventive solution, this study received the AAAI classic paper award in 2018. By far her most widely distributed work, however, was the Ontology 101 tutorial, which Noy developed as part of the education program for Protégé customers, the tutorial became a standard introductory document for the semantic web and ontologies, It has been cited nearly 6800 times as of 2018, and downloaded often.\n\n\n=== Google Dataset Search ===\nIn April 2014, Noy went to Google Research; Google has released a search engine to help researchers find publicly available online data. On September 5, the program was launched, and it is aimed towards \"scientists, data journalists, data geeks, or anybody else.\" Dataset Search, which is now following Google's other specialized search engines including news and picture search, as well as Google Scholar and Google Books, locates files and databases based on how their owners have categorised them. It does not read the content of the files in the same manner that search engines read web pages. Researchers who want to know what kinds of data are accessible or who want to find data that they already know exists, according to Natasha Noy, must often rely on word of mouth, this problem is particularly acute, according to Noy, for early-career academics who have yet to \"connect\" into a network of professional ties. Noy and her Google colleague Dan Brickley wrote a blog post in January 2017 proposing a solution to the problem. Typical search engines operate in two stages: The first stage is to search the Internet for sites to index on a regular basis, the second stage is to rank those indexed sites so that the engine can return relevant results in order when a user puts in a search word. Owners of datasets should 'tag' them using a standardized vocabulary called Schema.org. According to Noy and Brickley, Google and three other search engine behemoths (Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex) created Schema.org to help search engines in scanning existing data sets.\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nNoy is best known for her work on the Protégé ontology editor and the Prompt alignment tool, for which she and co-author Mark Musen received the AAAI Classic Paper award in 2018, the AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of the most influential paper(s) from a specific conference year, with the time period examined advancing by one year per year. She was elected an AAAI Fellow in 2020 and an ACM Fellow in 2023.\n\n\n== References =="

        "context": "Magnus T. Hirschfeld (14 May 1868 – 14 May 1935) was a Jewish German physician and sexologist, whose citizenship was later revoked by the Nazi government. Hirschfeld was educated in philosophy, philology and medicine. An outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, Hirschfeld founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee and World League for Sexual Reform. He based his practice in Berlin-Charlottenburg during the Weimar period. Performance Studies and Rhetoric Professor Dustin Goltz characterized the committee as having carried out \"the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights\". \nHirschfeld is regarded as one of the most influential sexologists of the 20th century. He was targeted by early fascists and later the Nazis for being Jewish and gay. He was beaten by völkisch activists in 1920, and in 1933 his Institut für Sexualwissenschaft was looted and had its books burned by Nazis. Hirschfeld was forced into exile in France, where he died in 1935.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHirschfeld was born in Kolberg in Pomerania (since 1945 Kołobrzeg in Poland), to an Ashkenazi Jewish family, the son of highly regarded physician and Senior Medical Officer Hermann Hirschfeld. As a youth he attended Kolberg Cathedral School, which at the time was a Protestant school. In 1887–1888, he studied philosophy and philology in Breslau, and then from 1888 to 1892 medicine in Straßburg, Munich, Heidelberg, and Berlin. In 1892, he earned his medical degree.\nAfter his studies, he traveled through the United States for eight months, visiting the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and living from the proceeds of his writing for German journals. During his time in Chicago, Hirschfeld became involved with the homosexual subculture in that city. Struck by the essential similarities between the homosexual subcultures of Chicago and Berlin, Hirschfeld first developed his theory about the universality of homosexuality around the world, as he researched in books and newspaper articles about the existence of gay subcultures in Rio de Janeiro, Tangier, and Tokyo. Then he started a naturopathic practice in Magdeburg; in 1896, he moved his practice to Berlin-Charlottenburg. Hirschfeld became interested in gay rights because many of his gay patients took their own lives. In the German language, the word for suicide is Selbstmord ('self-murder'), which carried more judgmental and condemnatory connotations than its English language equivalent, making the subject of suicide a taboo in 19th century Germany.\nIn particular, Hirschfeld cited the story of one of his patients as a reason for his gay rights activism: a young army officer suffering from depression who killed himself in 1896, leaving behind a suicide note saying that despite his best efforts, he could not end his desires for other men, and so had ended his life out of his guilt and shame. In his suicide note, the officer wrote that he lacked the \"strength\" to tell his parents the \"truth\", and spoke of his shame of \"that which nearly strangled my heart\". The officer could not even bring himself to use the word \"homosexuality\", which he instead conspicuously referred to as \"that\" in his note. However, the officer mentioned at the end of his suicide note: \"The thought that you [Hirschfeld] could contribute a future when the German fatherland will think of us in more just terms sweetens the hour of my death.\" Hirschfeld had been treating the officer for depression in 1895–1896, and the use of the term \"us\" led to speculation that a relationship existed between the two. However, the officer's use of Sie, the formal German word for you, instead of the informal Du, suggests Hirschfeld's relationship with his patient was strictly professional.\nAt the same time, Hirschfeld was greatly affected by the trial of Oscar Wilde, which he often referred to in his writings. Hirschfeld was struck by the number of his gay patients who had Suizidalnarben ('scars left by suicide attempts'), and often found himself trying to give his patients a reason to live.\n\n\n== Sexual rights activism ==\n\n\n=== Scientific-Humanitarian Committee ===\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld found a balance between practicing medicine and writing about his findings. Between 1 May–15 October 1896, the Große Berliner Gewerbeausstellung ('Great Business Exhibition of Berlin') took place, which featured nine \"human zoos\" where people from Germany's colonies in New Guinea and Africa were put on display for the visitors to gawk at. Such exhibitions of colonised peoples were common at industrial fairs, and later after Qingdao, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands became part of the German empire, Chinese, Chamorros, and Micronesians joined the Africans and New Guineans displayed in the \"human zoos\". Hirschfeld, who was keenly interested in sexuality in other cultures, visited the Große Berliner Gewerbeausstellung and subsequently other exhibitions to inquire of the people in the \"human zoos\" via interpreters about the status of sexuality in their cultures. It was in 1896, after talking to the people displayed in the \"human zoos\" at the Große Berliner Gewerbeausstellung, that Hirschfeld began writing what became his 1914 book Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes (The Homosexuality of Men and Women), an attempt to comprehensively survey homosexuality around the world, as part of an effort to prove that homosexuality occurred in every culture. In the book, Hirschfeld found that many homosexuals considered England to be the country with the highest rate of homosexuality. In addition to his book on homosexuality, Hirschfeld wrote a book on transvestism in 1910 known as Die Transvestiten: Eine Untersuchung über den Erotischen Verkleidungstrieb (Transvestites: The Erotic Drive to Cross-Dress).\nAfter several years as a general practitioner in Magdeburg, in 1896 he issued a pamphlet, Sappho and Socrates, on homosexual love (under the pseudonym Th. Ramien). In 1897, Hirschfeld founded the Scientific Humanitarian Committee with the publisher Max Spohr (1850–1905), the lawyer Eduard Oberg (1858–1917), and the writer Franz Joseph von Bülow (1861–1915). The group aimed to undertake research to defend the rights of homosexuals and to repeal Paragraph 175, the section of the German penal code that, since 1871, had criminalized homosexuality. They argued that the law encouraged blackmail. The motto of the committee, \"Justice through science\", reflected Hirschfeld's belief that a better scientific understanding of homosexuality would eliminate social hostility toward homosexuals.\nWithin the group, some of the members rejected Hirschfeld's (and Ulrichs's) view that male homosexuals are, by nature, effeminate. Benedict Friedlaender and some others left the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee and formed another group, the Bund für männliche Kultur or 'Union for Male Culture', which did not exist long. It argued that male–male love is an aspect of virile manliness, rather than a special condition. Under Hirschfeld's leadership, the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee gathered 6000 signatures from prominent Germans on a petition to overturn Paragraph 175. Signatories included Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, Käthe Kollwitz, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, August Bebel, Max Brod, Karl Kautsky, Stefan Zweig, Gerhart Hauptmann, Martin Buber, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, and Eduard Bernstein. The bill was brought before the Reichstag in 1898, but was supported only by a minority from the Social Democratic Party of Germany. August Bebel, a friend of Hirschfeld from his university days, agreed to sponsor the attempt to repeal Paragraph 175.\nHirschfeld considered what would, in a later era, be described as \"outing\": forcing out of the closet some of the prominent and secretly homosexual lawmakers who had remained silent on the bill. He arranged for the bill to be reintroduced and, in the 1920s, it made some progress until the takeover of the Nazi Party ended all hope for any such reform. As part of his efforts to counter popular prejudice, Hirschfeld spoke out about the taboo subject of suicide and was the first to present statistical evidence that homosexuals were more likely to commit suicide or attempt suicide than heterosexuals. Hirschfeld prepared questionnaires that gay men could answer anonymously about homosexuality and suicide. Collating his results, Hirschfeld estimated that 3 out of every 100 gays committed suicide every year, that a quarter of gays had attempted suicide at some point in their lives and that the other three-quarters had had suicidal thoughts at some point. He used his evidence to argue that, under current social conditions in Germany, life was literally unbearable for homosexuals.\nA figure frequently mentioned by Hirschfeld to illustrate the \"hell experienced by homosexuals\" was Oscar Wilde, who was a well-known author in Germany, and whose trials in 1895 had been extensively covered by the German press. Hirschfeld visited Cambridge University in 1905 to meet Wilde's son, Vyvyan Holland, who had changed his surname to avoid being associated with his father. Hirschfeld noted \"the name Wilde\" has, since his trial, sounded like \"an indecent word, which causes homosexuals to blush with shame, women to avert their eyes, and normal men to be outraged\". During his visit to Britain, Hirschfeld was invited to a secret ceremony in the English countryside where a \"group of beautiful, young, male students\" from Cambridge gathered together wearing Wilde's prison number, C33, as a way of symbolically linking his fate to theirs, to read out aloud Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\". Hirschfeld found the reading of \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" to be \"markerschütternd\" (shaken to the core of one's being, i.e. something that is emotionally devastating), going on to write that the poem reading was \"the most earth-shattering outcry that has ever been voiced by a downtrodden soul about its own torture and that of humanity\". By the end of the reading of \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\", Hirshfeld felt \"quiet joy\" as he was convinced that, despite the way that Wilde's life had been ruined, something good would eventually come of it.\n\n\n==== Feminism ====\nIn 1905, Hirschfeld joined the Bund für Mutterschutz ('League for the Protection of Mothers'), the feminist organization founded by Helene Stöcker. He campaigned for the decriminalisation of abortion, and against policies that banned female teachers and civil servants from marrying or having children. Both Hirschfeld and Stöcker believed that there was a close connection between the causes of gay rights and women's rights, and Stöcker was much involved in the campaign to repeal Paragraph 175 while Hirschfeld campaigned for the repeal of Paragraph 218, which had banned abortion. From 1909 to 1912, Stöcker, Hirschfeld, Hedwig Dohm, and others successfully campaigned against an extension to Paragraph 175 which would have criminalised female homosexuality.\nIn 1906, Hirschfeld was asked as a doctor to examine a prisoner in Neumünster to see if he was suffering from \"severe nervous disturbances caused by a combination of malaria, blackwater fever, and congenital sexual anomaly\". The man, a former soldier and a veteran of what Hirschfeld called the Hereroaufstand ('Herero revolt') in German Southwest Africa (modern Namibia) appeared to be suffering from what would now be considered post-traumatic stress disorder, saying that he had done terrible things in Southwest Africa, and could no longer live with himself. In 1904, the Herero and Namaqua peoples who had been steadily pushed off their land to make way for German settlers, had revolted, causing Kaiser Wilhelm II to dispatch General Lothar von Trotha to wage a \"war of annihilation\" to exterminate the Herero and Namaqua in what has since become known as the Herero and Namaqua genocide. The genocide came to widespread attention when the SPD leader August Bebel criticized the government on the floor of the Reichstag, saying the government did not have the right to exterminate the Herero just because they were Black. Hirschfeld did not mention his diagnosis of the prisoner, nor he did mention in detail the source of the prisoner's guilt about his actions in Southwest Africa; the German scholar Heike Bauer criticized him for his seeming unwillingness to see the connection between the Herero genocide and the prisoner's guilt, which had caused him to engage in a petty crime wave.\nHirschfeld's position, that homosexuality was normal and natural, made him a highly controversial figure at the time, involving him in vigorous debates with other academics, who regarded homosexuality as unnatural and wrong. One of Hirschfeld's leading critics was Austrian Baron Christian von Ehrenfels, who advocated radical changes to society and sexuality to combat the supposed \"Yellow Peril\", and saw Hirschfeld's theories as a challenge to his view of sexuality. Ehrenfels argued that there were a few \"biologically degenerate\" homosexuals who lured otherwise \"healthy boys\" into their lifestyle, making homosexuality into both a choice and a wrong one at that time.\n\n\n==== African anthropology ====\n\nAt the same time, Hirschfeld became involved in a debate with a number of anthropologists about the supposed existence of the Hottentottenschürze ('Hottentot apron'), namely the belief that the Khoekoe (known to Westerners as Hottentots) women of southern Africa had abnormally enlarged labia, which made them inclined toward lesbianism. Hirschfeld argued there was no evidence that the Khoekoe women had abnormally large labia, whose supposed existence had fascinated so many Western anthropologists at the time, and that, other than being Black, the bodies of Khoekoe women were no different from German women. One Khoekoe woman, Sarah Baartman, the \"Hottentot Venus\", did have relatively large buttocks and labia, compared to Northern European women, and had been exhibited at a freak show in Europe in the early 19th century, which was the origin of this belief about the Khoekhoe women. Hirschfeld wrote: \"The differences appear minimal compared to what is shared\" between Khoekoe and German women.\nTurning the argument of the anthropologists on their head, Hirschfeld argued that, if same-sex relationships were common among Khoekoe women, and if the bodies of Khoekoe women were essentially the same as Western women, then Western women must have the same tendencies. Hirschfeld's theories about a spectrum of sexuality existing in all of the world's cultures implicitly undercut the binary theories about the differences between various races that was the basis of the claim of white supremacy. However, Bauer wrote that Hirschfeld's theories about the universality of homosexuality paid little attention to cultural contexts, and criticized him for his remarks that Hausa women in Nigeria were well known for their lesbian tendencies and would have been executed for their sapphic acts before British rule, as assuming that imperialism was always good for the colonized.\n\n\n=== Eulenburg affair ===\nHirschfeld played a prominent role in the Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1906–09, which became the most widely publicized sex scandal in Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907, when General Kuno von Moltke sued the journalist Maximilian Harden, after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg, who was the Kaiser's best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. In his role as an expert witness, Hirschfeld testified that Moltke was gay and, thus, what Harden had written was true. Hirschfeld – who wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany – believed that proving Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization. He also testified that he believed there was nothing wrong with Moltke.\nMost notably, Hirschfeld testified that \"homosexuality was part of the plan of nature and creation just like normal love.\" Hirschfeld's testimony caused outrage all over Germany. The Vossische Zeitung newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as \"a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience\". The Münchener Neuesten Nachrichten newspaper declared in an editorial: \"Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science, which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!\" A notable witness at the trial was Lilly von Elbe, former wife of Moltke, who testified that her husband had only had sex with her twice in their entire marriage. Elbe spoke with remarkable openness for the period of her sexual desires and her frustration with a husband who was only interested in having sex with Eulenburg. Elbe's testimony was marked by moments of low comedy when it emerged that she had taken to attacking Moltke with a frying pan in vain attempts to make him have sex with her. The fact that General von Moltke was unable to defend himself from his wife's attacks was taken as proof that he was deficient in his masculinity, which many saw as confirming his homosexuality. At the time, the subject of female sexuality was taboo, and Elbe's testimony was controversial, with many saying that Elbe must be mentally ill because of her willingness to acknowledge her sexuality.  Letters to the newspapers at the time, from both men and women, overwhelmingly condemned Elbe for her \"disgusting\" testimony concerning her sexuality. As an expert witness, Hirschfeld also testified that female sexuality was natural, and Elbe was just a normal woman who was in no way mentally ill. After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury's decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld. He overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals \"have the morals of dogs\", and insisted that this verdict could not be allowed to stand.\nAfter the verdict was overturned, a second trial found Harden guilty of libel. At the second trial, Hirschfeld again testified as an expert witness, but this time, he was much less certain than he had been at the first trial about Moltke's homosexuality. Hirschfeld testified that Moltke and Eulenburg had an \"intimate\" friendship that was homoerotic in nature but not sexual, as he had testified at the first trial. Hirschfeld also testified that, though he still believed female sexuality was normal, Elbe was suffering from hysteria caused by a lack of sex, and so the court should discount her stories about a sexual relationship between Moltke and Eulenburg. Hirschfeld had been threatened by the Prussian government with having his medical license revoked if he testified as an expert witness again along the same lines that he had at the first trial, and possibly prosecuted for violating Paragraph 175. The trial was a libel suit against Harden by Moltke, but much of the testimony had concerned Eulenburg, whose status as the best friend of Wilhelm II meant that the scandal threatened to involve the Kaiser. Moreover, far from precipitating increased tolerance as Hirschfeld had expected, the scandal led to a major homophobic and anti-Semitic backlash, and Hirschfeld's biographer Elena Mancini speculated that Hirschfeld wanted to bring to an end an affair that was hindering rather helping the cause for gay rights.\nBecause Eulenburg was a prominent anti-Semite and Hirschfeld was a Jew, during the affair, the völkisch movement came out in support of Eulenburg, whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual, framed by false allegations of homosexuality by Hirschfeld and Harden. Various völkisch leaders, most notably the radical anti-Semitic journalist Theodor Fritsch, used the Eulenburg affair as a chance to \"settle the accounts\" with the Jews. As a gay Jew, Hirschfeld was relentlessly vilified by the völkisch newspapers. Outside Hirschfeld's house in Berlin, posters were affixed by völkisch activists, which read \"Dr. Hirschfeld A Public Danger: The Jews are Our Undoing!\". In Nazi Germany, the official interpretation of the Eulenburg affair was that Eulenburg was a straight Aryan whose career was destroyed by false claims of being gay by Jews like Hirschfeld. After the scandal had ended, Hirschfeld concluded that, far from helping the gay rights movement as he had hoped, the ensuing backlash set the movement back. The conclusion drawn by the German government was the opposite of the one that Hirschfeld wanted; the fact that prominent men like General von Moltke and Eulenburg were gay did not lead the government to repeal Paragraph 175 as Hirschfeld had hoped and, instead, the government decided that Paragraph 175 was being enforced with insufficient vigor, leading to a crackdown on homosexuals that was unprecedented and would not be exceeded until the Nazi era.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn 1914, Hirschfeld was swept up by the national enthusiasm of the Spirit of 1914, as the sense of national solidarity was known that at the outbreak of World War I rallied the majority of Germans to the defence of the Fatherland. Initially pro-war, Hirschfeld started to turn against the war in 1915, moving toward a pacifist position. In his 1915 pamphlet, Warum Hassen uns die Völker? ('Why do other nations hate us?'), Hirschfeld answered his own question by arguing that it was the greatness of Germany that excited envy from other nations, especially Great Britain, and so had supposedly caused them to come together to destroy the Reich. Hirschfeld accused Britain of starting the war in 1914 \"out of envy at the development and size of the German Empire\". Warum Hassen uns die Völker? was characterized by a chauvinist and ultra-nationalist tone, together with a crass Anglophobia that has often embarrassed Hirschfeld's modern admirers such as Charlotte Wolff, who called the pamphlet a \"perversion of the values which Hirschfeld had always stood for\".\nAs a Jewish homosexual, Hirschfeld was acutely aware that many Germans did not consider him to be a \"proper\" German, or even a German at all; so, he reasoned that taking an ultra-patriotic stance might break down prejudices by showing that German Jews and/or homosexuals could also be good, patriotic Germans, rallying to the cry of the Fatherland. By 1916, Hirschfeld was writing pacifist pamphlets, calling for an immediate end to the war. In his 1916 pamphlet Kriegspsychologisches ('The Psychology of War'), Hirschfeld was far more critical of the war than he had been in 1915, emphasizing the suffering and trauma caused by it. He also expressed the opinion that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the war because its horrors were \"superhuman in size\". He declared that \"it is not enough that the war ends with peace; it must end with reconciliation\". In late 1918, Hirschfeld together with his sister, Franziska Mann, co-wrote a pamphlet Was jede Frau vom Wahlrecht wissen muß! ('What every woman needs to know about the right to vote!') hailing the November Revolution for granting German women the right to vote and announced the \"eyes of the world are now resting on German women\".\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nIn 1920, Hirschfeld was badly beaten by a group of völkisch activists who attacked him on the street; he was initially declared dead when the police arrived. In 1921, Hirschfeld organised the First Congress for Sexual Reform, which led to the formation of the World League for Sexual Reform. Congresses were held in Copenhagen (1928), London (1929), Vienna (1930), and Brno (1932).\n\nHirschfeld was both quoted and caricatured in the press as a vociferous expert on sexual matters; during his 1931 tour of the United States, the Hearst newspaper chain dubbed him \"the Einstein of Sex\". He identified as a campaigner and a scientist, investigating and cataloging many varieties of sexuality, not just homosexuality. He developed a system which categorised 64 possible types of sexual intermediary, ranging from masculine, heterosexual male to feminine, homosexual male, including those he described under the term transvestite (German: Transvestit), which he coined in 1910, and those he described under the term transsexuals, a term he coined in 1923. He also made a distinction between transsexualism and intersexuality.\nAt this time, Hirschfeld and the Institute for Sexual Sciences issued a number of transvestite passes to trans people in order to prevent them from being harassed by the police.\n\n\n=== Anders als die Andern ===\nHirschfeld co-wrote and acted in the 1919 film Anders als die Andern ('Different From the Others'), in which Conrad Veidt played one of the first homosexual characters ever written for cinema. The film had a specific gay rights law reform agenda; after Veidt's character is blackmailed by a male prostitute, he eventually comes out rather than continuing to make the blackmail payments. His career is destroyed and he is driven to suicide. Hirschfeld played himself in Anders als die Andern, where the title cards have him say: \"The persecution of homosexuals belongs to the same sad chapter of history in which the persecutions of witches and heretics is inscribed... Only with the French Revolution did a complete change come about. Everywhere where the Code Napoléon was introduced, the laws against homosexuals were repealed, for they were considered a violation of the rights of the individual... In Germany, however, despite more than fifty years of scientific research, legal discrimination against homosexuals continues unabated... May justice soon prevail over injustice in this area, science conquer superstition, love achieve victory over hatred!\"\nIn May 1919, when the film premiered in Berlin, the First World War was still a very fresh memory and German conservatives, who already hated Hirschfeld, seized upon his Francophile speech in the film praising France for legalizing homosexuality in 1792 as evidence that gay rights were \"un-German\". At the end of the film, when the protagonist Paul Körner commits suicide, his lover Kurt is planning on killing himself, when Hirschfeld appears to tell him: \"If you want to honor the memory of your dead friend, you must not take your own life, but instead preserve it to change the prejudices whose victim – one of the countless many – this dead man was. That is the task of the living I assign you. Just as Zola struggled on behalf of a man who innocently languished in prison, what matters now is to restore honor and justice to the many thousands before us, with us, and after us. Through knowledge to justice!\" The reference to Émile Zola's role in the Dreyfus affair was intended to draw a parallel between homophobia and anti-Semitism, while Hirschfeld's repeated use of the word \"us\" was an implied admission of his own homosexuality. The anti-suicide message of Anders als die Andern reflected Hirschfeld's interest in the subject of the high suicide rate among homosexuals, and was intended to give hope to gay audiences. The film ends with Hirschfeld opening a copy of the penal code of the Reich and striking out Paragraph 175 with a giant X.\n\n\n== Institut für Sexualwissenschaft ==\n\nUnder the more liberal atmosphere of the newly founded Weimar Republic, Hirschfeld purchased a villa not far from the Reichstag building in Berlin for his new Institut für Sexualwissenschaft ('Institute of Sexual Research'), which opened on 6 July 1919. In Germany, the Reich government made laws, but the Länder governments enforced the laws, meaning it was up to the Länder governments to enforce Paragraph 175. Until the November Revolution of 1918, Prussia had a three-class voting system that effectively disenfranchised most ordinary people, and allowed the Junkers to dominate Prussia. After the November Revolution, universal suffrage came to Prussia, which became a stronghold of the Social Democrats. The SPD believed in repealing Paragraph 175, and the Social Democratic Prussian government headed by Otto Braun ordered the Prussian police not to enforce Paragraph 175, making Prussia into a haven for homosexuals all over Germany. The Institute housed Hirschfeld's immense archives and library on sexuality and provided educational services and medical consultations; the clinical staff included psychiatrists Felix Abraham and Arthur Kronfeld, gynecologist Ludwig Levy-Lenz, dermatologist and endocrinologist Bernard Schapiro, and dermatologist Friedrich Wertheim. The institute also housed the Museum of Sex, an educational resource for the public, which is reported to have been visited by school classes. Hirschfeld himself lived at the Institution on the second floor with his partner, Karl Giese, together with his sister Recha Tobias (1857–1942).\nGiese and Hirschfeld were a well-known couple in the gay scene in Berlin where Hirschfeld was popularly known as Tante Magnesia. Tante ('aunt') was a German slang expression for a gay man but did not mean, as some claim, that Hirschfeld himself cross-dressed. People from around Europe and beyond came to the institute to gain a clearer understanding of their sexuality. Christopher Isherwood writes about his and W. H. Auden's visit in his book Christopher and His Kind; they were calling on Francis Turville-Petre, a friend of Isherwood's who was an active member of the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. Other celebrated visitors included German novelist and playwright Gerhart Hauptmann, German artist Christian Schad, French writers René Crevel and André Gide, Russian director Sergei Eisenstein, and American poet Elsa Gidlow.\nIn addition, a number of noted individuals lived for longer or shorter periods of time in the various rooms available for rent or as free accommodations in the Institute complex. Among the residents were Isherwood and Turville-Petre; literary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin; actress and dancer Anita Berber; Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch; Willi Münzenberg, a member of the German Parliament and a press officer for the Communist Party of Germany; Dora Richter, one of the first transgender patients to receive sex reassignment surgery at the institute, and Lili Elbe. Richter had been previously arrested for cross-dressing and discharged from the military. At the suggestion of a close friend, she later came to the institute for help. Hirschfeld had coined the term transvestite in 1910 to describe what today would be called transgender people, and the institution became a haven for transgender people, where Hirschfeld offered them shelter from abuse, performed surgeries, and gave otherwise unemployable transgender people jobs, albeit of a menial type, mostly as \"maids\".\nThe Institute and Hirschfeld's work are depicted in Rosa von Praunheim's feature film Der Einstein des Sex (The Einstein of Sex, Germany, 1999; English subtitled version available). Although inspired by Hirschfeld's life, the film is fictional. It contains invented characters and incidents and attributes motives and sentiments to Hirschfeld and others on the basis of little or no historical evidence. Hirschfeld biographer Ralf Dose notes, for instance, that \"the figure of 'Dorchen' in Rosa von Praunheim's film The Einstein of Sex is complete fiction.\"\n\n\n== World tour ==\nIn March 1930, the Social Democratic chancellor Hermann Müller was overthrown by the intrigues of General Kurt von Schleicher. \"Presidential\" governments, responsible only to the President Paul von Hindenburg, pushed German politics in a more authoritarian direction. In 1929, the Müller government had come very close to repealing Paragraph 175, when the Reichstag justice committee voted to repeal Paragraph 175. However, the Müller government fell before it could submit the repeal motion to the floor of the Reichstag. Heinrich Brüning, a conservative Catholic on the right-wing of the Zentrum party replaced Müller in March 1930, and was openly hostile toward gay rights and the fall of Müller ended the possibility of repealing Paragraph 175. Under the rule of Brüning as Chancellor and that of his successor, Franz von Papen, the state became increasingly hostile toward gay rights campaigners such as Hirschfeld, who began to spend more time abroad. Quite apart from the increased homophobia, Hirschfeld also became involved in a bitter debate within the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, as the repeal bill championed by Müller also made homosexual prostitution illegal, which badly divided the committee. Hirschfeld had always argued that \"what is natural cannot be immoral\" and, since homosexuality was in his view natural, it should be legal. Connecting the question of the legality of homosexuality to the legality of prostitution was a blurring of the issue, since these were different matters.\n\n\n=== America and a \"straight turn\" ===\nIn 1930, Hirschfeld predicted that there would be no future for people like himself in Germany, and he would have to move abroad. In November 1930, Hirschfeld arrived in New York City, ostensibly on a speaking tour about sex, but in fact to see if it was possible for him to settle in the United States. Significantly, in his speeches on this American tour, Hirschfeld, when speaking in German, called for the legalization of homosexuality, but when speaking in English did not mention the subject of homosexuality, instead urging Americans to be more open-minded about heterosexual sex. The New York Times described Hirschfeld as having come to America to \"study the marriage question\", while the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung newspaper described Hirschfeld as wanting to \"discuss love's natural turns\" – the phrase \"love's natural turns\" was Hirschfeld's way of presenting his theory that there was a wide spectrum of human sexuality, all of which were \"natural\". Hirschfeld realized that most Americans did not want to hear about his theory of homosexuality as natural. Aware of a strong xenophobic tendency in the United States, where foreigners seen as troublemakers were unwelcome, Hirschfeld tailored his message to American tastes.\nIn an interview with the Germanophile American journalist George Sylvester Viereck for the Milwaukee Sentinel  in late November 1930 that epitomised his \"straight turn\" in America, Hirschfeld was presented as a sex expert whose knowledge could improve the sex lives of married American couples. The Milwaukee Sentinel was part of the newspaper chain owned by William Randolph Hearst, which initially promoted Hirschfeld in America, reflecting the old adage that \"sex sells\". In the interview with Viereck, Hirschfeld was presented as the wise \"European expert on romantic love\" who had come to teach heterosexual American men how to enjoy sex, claiming there was a close connection between sexual and emotional intimacy. Clearly intending to flatter the egos of a heterosexual American male audience, Hirschfeld praised the drive and ambition of American men, who were so successful at business, but stated that American men needed to divert some of their energy to their sex lives. Hirschfeld added, he had seen signs that American men were now starting to develop their \"romantic sides\" as European men had long since done, and he had come to the United States to teach American men how to love their women properly. When Viereck objected that the U.S. was in the middle of the Great Depression, Hirschfeld replied he was certain that United States would soon recover, thanks to the relentless drive of American men.\n\nAt least part of the reason for his \"straight turn\" was financial; a Dutch firm had been marketing Titus Pearls (Titus-Perlen) pills, which were presented in Europe as a cure for \"scattered nerves\" and in the United States as an aphrodisiac, and had been using Hirschfeld's endorsement to help with advertising campaign there. Most Americans knew of Hirschfeld only as a \"world-known authority on sex\" who had endorsed the Titus Pearls pills, which were alleged to improve orgasms for both men and women. Since Hirschfeld's books never sold well, the money he was paid for endorsing the Titus Pearls pills were a major source of income for him, which he was to lose in 1933 when the manufacturer of the pills ceased using his endorsement in order to stay in the German market. In a second interview with Viereck in February 1931, Hirschfeld was presented by him as the \"Einstein of Sex\", which was again part of the marketing effort of Hirschfeld's \"straight turn\" in America. At times, Hirschfeld returned to his European message, when he planned to deliver a talk at the bohemian Dill Pickle Club in Chicago on \"homosexuality with beautiful revealing pictures\", which was banned by the city as indecent. In San Francisco, Hirschfeld visited San Quentin prison to meet Thomas Mooney, whose belief in his innocence he proclaimed to the press afterward, and asked for his release. Unfortunately for Hirschfeld, the Hearst newspapers, which specialized in taking a sensationalist, right-wing, populist line on the news, dug up his statements in Germany calling for gay rights, causing a sudden shift in tone from more or less friendly to hostile, effectively ending any chance of Hirschfeld being allowed to stay in the United States.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\nAfter his American tour, Hirschfeld went to Asia in February 1931. Hirschfeld had been invited to Japan by Keizō Dohi, a German-educated Japanese doctor who spoke fluent German and who worked at Hirschfeld's institute for a time in the 1920s. In Japan, Hirchfeld again tailored his speeches to local tastes, saying nothing about gay rights, and merely argued that a greater frankness about sexual matters would prevent venereal diseases. Hirschfeld sought out an old friend, S. Iwaya, a Japanese doctor who lived in Berlin in 1900–02 and who joined the Scientific-Humanitarian committee during his time there. Iwaya took Hirschfeld to the Meiji-za to introduce him to the Kabuki theater. Hirschfeld become interested in the Kabuki theater, where the female characters are played by men. One of the Kabuki actors, speaking to Hirschfeld via Iwaya, who served as the translator, was most insistent about asking him if he really looked like a woman on stage and was he effeminate enough as an actor. Hirschfeld noted that no one in Japan looked down on Kabuki actors who played female characters; on the contrary, they were popular figures with the public. Hirschfeld also met a number of Japanese feminists, such as Shidzue Katō and Fusae Ichikawa, whom he praised for their efforts to give Japanese women the right to vote. This greatly annoyed the Japanese government, which did not appreciate a foreigner criticizing the denial of female suffrage. Shortly before leaving Tokyo for China, Hirschfeld expressed the hope that his host and translator, Wilhelm Grundert, the director of the German–Japanese Cultural Institute, be made a professor at a German university. Grundert joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and, in 1936, was made a professor of Japanese studies at the University of Hamburg and, in 1938, become the chancellor of Hamburg university, all the while denouncing his former friend Hirschfeld as a \"pervert\". In Shanghai, Hirschfeld began a relationship with a 23-year-old Chinese man studying sexology, Li Shiu Tong (also known by his nickname Tao Li), who remained his partner for the rest of his life. Hirschfeld promised Tao that he would introduce him to German culture, saying he wanted to take him to a \"Bavarian beer hall\" to show him how German men drank. Tao's parents, who knew about their son's sexual orientation and accepted his relationship with Hirschfeld, threw a farewell party when the two left China, with Tao's father expressing the hope that his son would become the \"Hirschfeld of China\".\nAfter staying in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), where Hirschfeld caused an uproar by speech comparing Dutch imperialism to slavery, Hirschfeld arrived in India in September 1931. In Allahabad, Hirschfeld met Jawaharlal Nehru and gave speeches supporting the Indian independence movement, stating \"it is one of the biggest injustices in the world that one of the oldest civilized nations... cannot rule independently\". However, Hirschfeld's Indian speeches were mainly concerned with attacking the 1927 book Mother India by the white supremacist American author Katherine Mayo, where she painted an unflattering picture of sexuality in India as brutal and perverted, as \"England-friendly propaganda\". As Mayo's book had caused much controversy in India, Hirschfeld's speeches defending Indians against her accusations were well received. Hirschfeld, who was fluent in English, made a point of quoting from the articles written by W. T. Stead in The Pall Mall Gazette in 1885, exposing rampant child prostitution in London as proving that sexuality in Britain could also be brutal and perverted: a matter which, he noted, did not interest Mayo in the slightest. Hirschfeld was very interested in the subject of Indian sexuality or, as he called it, \"the Indian art of love\". Hirschfeld's main guide to India was Girindrasekhar Bose and, in general, Hirschfeld's contacts were limited to the English-speaking Indian elite, as he did not speak Hindi or any other Indian languages. While staying in Patna, Hirschfeld drew up a will naming Tao as his main beneficiary and asking Tao, if he should die, to take his ashes to be buried at the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin.\n\n\n=== Africa and the Middle East ===\nIn Egypt, where Hirschfeld and Tao traveled to next, arriving in November 1931, Hirschfeld wrote \"to the Arabs... homoerotic love practice is something natural and that Mohammad could not change this attitude\". In Cairo, Hirschfeld and Tao met the Egyptian feminist leader Huda Sha'arawi-who stopped wearing the Muslim veil in 1923 and popularized going unveiled which, for Hirschfeld, illustrated how gender roles could change. In a rebuke to Western notions of superiority, Hirschfeld wrote \"the average ethical and intellectual levels of the Egyptians was equal to that of the European nations\". Hirschfeld's visit to the Palestine Mandate (present-day Palestine and Israel) marked one of the few times when he publicly referred to his Jewishness saying, as a Jew, it was greatly moving to visit Jerusalem. Hirschfeld was not a religious Jew, stating that Gottesfurcht ('fear of God', i.e. religious belief) was irrational, but that he did feel a certain sentimental attachment to Palestine. In general, Hirschfeld was supportive of Zionism, but expressed concern about what he regarded as certain chauvinist tendencies in the Zionist movement and he deplored the adoption of Hebrew as the lingua franca saying, if only the Jews of Palestine spoke German rather than Hebrew, he would have stayed. In March 1932, Hirschfeld arrived in Athens, where he told journalists that, regardless of whether Hindenburg or Hitler won the presidential election that month, he probably would not return to Germany, as both men were equally homophobic.\n\n\n== Later life and exile ==\n\nOn 20 July 1932, the Chancellor Franz von Papen carried out a coup that deposed the Braun government in Prussia, and appointed himself the Reich commissioner for the state. A conservative Catholic who had long been a vocal critic of homosexuality, Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down in general on \"sexual immorality\" in Prussia. The Institut für Sexualwissenschaft remained open, but under Papen's rule, the police began to harass people associated with it. On 30 January 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as chancellor. Less than four months after the Nazis took power, Hirschfeld's Institute was sacked. On the morning of 6 May, a group of university students belonging to the National Socialist German Students' League stormed the institution, shouting \"Brenne Hirschfeld!\" ('Burn Hirschfeld!') and began to beat up its staff and smash up the premises. In the afternoon, the SA came to the institute, carrying out a more systematic attack, removing all volumes from the library and storing them for a book-burning event which was to be held four days later. In the evening, the Berlin Police arrived at the institution and announced that it was closed forever.\nBy the time of the book burning, Hirschfeld had long since left Germany for a speaking tour that took him around the world; he never returned to Germany. In March 1932, he stopped briefly in Athens, spent several weeks in Vienna and then settled in Zurich, Switzerland, in August 1932. While he was there, he worked on a book that recounted his experiences and observations while he was on his world tour and it was published in 1933 as Die Weltreise eines Sexualforschers (Brugg, Switzerland: Bözberg-Verlag, 1933). It was published in an English translation in the United States under the title Men and Women: The World Journey of a Sexologist (New York City: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1935) and in England under the title Women East and West: Impressions of a Sex Expert (London: William Heinemann Medical Books, 1935). Hirschfeld stayed near Germany, hoping that he would be able to return to Berlin if the country's political situation improved. With the Nazi regime's unequivocal rise to power coinciding with the completion of his work on his tour book, he decided to go into exile in France. On his 65th birthday, 14 May 1933, Hirschfeld arrived in Paris, where he lived in a luxury apartment building on 24 Avenue Charles Floquet, facing the Champ de Mars. Hirschfeld lived with Li and Giese. In 1934, Giese was involved in a dispute at a public bathhouse that Hirschfeld called \"trifling\", but it led French authorities to expel him. Giese's fate left Hirschfeld very depressed.\nA year-and-a-half after arriving in France, in November 1934, Hirschfeld moved south to Nice, a seaside resort on the Mediterranean coast. He lived in a luxurious apartment building with a view of the sea across an enormous garden on the Promenade des Anglais. Throughout his stay in France, he continued researching, writing, campaigning and working to establish a French successor to his lost institute in Berlin. Hirschfeld's sister, Recha Tobias, did not leave Germany and died in the Theresienstadt Ghetto on 28 September 1942 (the cause of death entered in her death certificate was \"heart weakness\"). While in France, Hirschfeld finished a book that he had been writing during his world tour, Rassismus (Racism). It was published posthumously in English in 1938. Hirschfeld wrote that the purpose of the book was to explore \"the racial theory which underlines the doctrine of racial war\", saying that he himself was \"numbered among the many thousands who have fallen victim to the practical realization of this theory.\" Unlike many who saw the völkisch ideology of the Nazi regime as an aberration and a retrogression from modernity, Hirschfeld insisted that it had deep roots, going back to the German Enlightenment in the 18th century, and it was a part of modernity rather than an aberration from it. He added that, in the 19th century, an ideology that divided all of humanity into biologically different races – white, black, yellow, brown, and red – as devised by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach – served as a way of turning prejudices into a \"universal truth\", apparently validated by science. In turn, Hirschfeld held the view that this pseudoscientific way of dividing humanity was the basis of Western thinking about modernity, with whites being praised as the \"civilized\" race in contrast to the other races, which were dismissed for their \"barbarism\"; such thinking was used to justify white supremacy.\nIn this way, he argued that the völkisch racism of the National Socialist regime was only an extreme variant of prejudices that were held throughout the Western world, and the differences between Nazi ideology and the racism that was practiced in other nations were differences in degree rather than differences in kind. Hirschfeld argued against this way of seeing the world, writing \"if it were practical, we should certainly do well to eradicate the use of the word 'race' as far as subdivisions of the human species are concerned; or if we do use it in this way, to put it into quote marks to show it is questionable\". The last of Hirschfeld's books to be published during his lifetime, L'Âme et l'amour, psychologie sexologique [The Human Spirit and Love: Sexological Psychology] (Paris: Gallimard, 1935), was published in French in late April 1935; it was his only book that was never published in a German-language edition. In the book's preface, he described his hopes for his new life in France:\n\nIn search of sanctuary, I have found my way to that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul. I shall be glad and grateful if I can spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more grateful to be enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn his 67th birthday, 14 May 1935, Hirschfeld died of a heart attack in his apartment at the Gloria Mansions I building at 63 Promenade des Anglais in Nice. His body was cremated, and the ashes interred in a simple tomb in the Caucade Cemetery in Nice. The upright headstone in gray granite is inset with a bronze bas-relief portrait of Hirschfeld in profile by German sculptor and decorative artist Arnold Zadikow (1884–1943), who like Hirschfeld was a native of the town of Kolberg. The slab covering the tomb is engraved with Hirschfeld's Latin motto, \"Per Scientiam ad Justitiam\" (\"through science to justice\"). The Caucade Cemetery is likewise the location of the grave of surgeon and sexual-rejuvenation proponent Serge Voronoff, whose work Hirschfeld had discussed in his own publications.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, to mark the 75th anniversary of Hirschfeld's death, a French national organization, the Mémorial de la Déportation Homosexuelle (MDH), in partnership with the new LGBT Community Center of Nice (Centre LGBT Côte d'Azur), organized a formal delegation to the cemetery. Speakers recalled Hirschfeld's life and work and laid a large bouquet of pink flowers on his tomb; the ribbon on the bouquet was inscribed \"Au pionnier de nos causes. Le MDH et le Centre LGBT\" ('To the pioneer of our causes. The MDH and the LGBT Center').\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAccording to Shtetl, Hirschfeld's \"radical ideas changed the way Germans thought about sexuality.\" American Henry Gerber, attached to the Allied Army of Occupation following World War I, became impressed by Hirschfeld and absorbed many of the doctor's ideas. Upon his return to the United States, Gerber was inspired to form the short-lived Chicago-based Society for Human Rights in 1924, the first known gay rights organization in the nation. In turn, a partner of one of the former members of the Society communicated the existence of the society to Los Angeles resident Harry Hay in 1929; Hay would go on to help establish the Mattachine Society in 1950, the first national homosexual rights organization to operate for many years in the United States. In 1979, the National LGBT Federation established the Hirschfeld Centre, Ireland's second gay and lesbian community centre. Although badly damaged by a 1987 fire, the centre continued to house the Gay Community News magazine until 1997.\nIn 1982, a group of German researchers and activists founded the Magnus Hirschfeld Society (German: Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft e.V.) in West Berlin, in anticipation of the approaching 50th anniversary of the destruction of Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Science. Ten years later, the society established a Berlin-based center for research on the history of sexology. Since the late 20th century, researchers associated with the Magnus Hirschfeld Society have succeeded in tracking down previously dispersed and lost records and artifacts of Hirschfeld's life and work. They have brought together many of these materials at the society's archives in Berlin. At an exhibition at the Schwules Museum in Berlin from 7 December 2011 to 31 March 2012, the society publicly displayed a selection of these collections for the first time.\n\nThe German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research established the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 1990. The Society awards the Medal in two categories, contributions to sexual research and contributions to sexual reform. The Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation, established in Germany in 2007, is named for Hirschfeld and lesbian activist FannyAnn Eddy. In May 2008, the promenade between Moltke Bridge and the Chancellor's Garden got renamed Magnus-Hirschfeld-Ufer. On this promenade, there is a Memorial plaque with a description in English. In August 2011, after 30 years of advocacy by the Magnus Hirschfeld Society and other associations and individuals, the Federal Cabinet of Germany granted 10 million euros to establish the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation (Bundesstiftung Magnus Hirschfeld), a foundation to support research and education about the life and work of Magnus Hirschfeld, the Nazi persecution of homosexuals, German LGBT culture and community, and ways to counteract prejudice against LGBT people; the Federal Ministry of Justice was expected to contribute an additional 5 million euros, bringing the initial endowment of the foundation to a total of 15 million euros. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Portrayals in popular culture ==\nHirschfeld has been portrayed in a number of works of popular culture both during his lifetime and subsequently. Following is a sampling of genres and titles:\n\n\n=== Podcasts ===\nSeason 4 episode 2 of the podcast Making Gay History is about Hirschfeld, as is a Special Episode in Season 5 of the Bad Gays Podcast.\n\n\n=== Caricature ===\nHirschfeld was a frequent target of caricatures in the popular press during his lifetime. Historian James Steakley reproduces several examples in his German-language book Die Freunde des Kaisers. Die Eulenburg-Affäre im Spiegel zeitgenössischer Karikaturen (Hamburg: MännerschwarmSkript, 2004). Additional examples appear in the French-language book Derrière \"lui\" (L'Homosexualité en Allemagne) (Paris: E. Bernard, [1908]) by John Grand-Carteret.\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\n\nDifferent from the Others (Germany, 1919); directed by Richard Oswald; cowritten by Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld appears in a cameo playing himself. Karl Giese, the young man who subsequently became Hirschfeld's lover, also had a part in the film.\nRace d'Ep: Un Siècle d'Images de l'Homosexualité (France, 1979); directed by Lionel Soukaz; cowritten by Soukaz and Guy Hocquenghem; released in the United States under the title The Homosexual Century. An experimental film portraying 100 years of homosexual history in four episodes, one of which focuses on Hirschfeld and his work. French gay writer Pierre Hahn played the role of Hirschfeld.\nDesire: Sexuality in Germany, 1910–1945 (United Kingdom, 1989); directed by Stuart Marshall. A feature-length documentary tracing the emergence of the homosexual subculture and the homosexual emancipation movement in pre-World War II Germany – and their destruction by the Nazi regime. According to film historian Robin Wood, Marshall \"treats the burning of Hirschfeld's library and the closing of his Institute of Sexual Science as the film's... central moment....\"\nA segment on Hirschfeld appears in episode 19 of Real Sex, first shown on HBO on 7 February 1998.\nThe Einstein of Sex (Germany, 1999); directed by Rosa von Praunheim. A fictional biopic inspired by Hirschfeld's life and work.\nParagraph 175 (US, 2000); directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. A feature-length documentary on the persecution of homosexuals during the Nazi regime. The first part of the film provides a brief overview of the history of the homosexual emancipation movement in Germany from the late 19th century through the early 1930s, with Hirschfeld and his work prominently featured.\nSeveral episodes of the second season of the Amazon television series Transparent (U.S., 2014–2019) include a portrayal of Hirschfeld and his institute. Hirschfeld was portrayed by Bradley Whitford.\n\n\n=== Fiction ===\n\nRobert Hichens (1939). That Which Is Hidden (London: Cassell & Company). U.S. Edition: New York: Doubleday, Doran & Company, 1940. The novel opens with the protagonist visiting the tomb of a famed Austrian sex expert, Dr. R. Ellendorf, in a cemetery in Nice. At the tomb, he meets the late doctor's protégé, a Chinese student named Kho Ling. The character of Ling refers to the memory of his mentor at numerous points in the novel. From the description of the settings and the characters, Ellendorf clearly was inspired by Hirschfeld, and Ling by Hirschfeld's last partner and heir, Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li).\nArno Schmidt (1970). Zettels Traum (Frankfurt-am-Main: S. Fischer Verlag). Hirschfeld is quoted often in this novel about sexuality.\nNicolas Verdan (2011). Le Patient du docteur Hirschfeld (Orbe, Switzerland: Bernard Campiche). A French-language spy thriller inspired by the sacking of Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Science by the Nazis.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nHirschfeld's works are listed in the following bibliography, which is extensive but not comprehensive:\n\nSteakley, James D.

        "context": "Subhash Kak is an Indian-American computer scientist and historical revisionist. He is the Regents Professor of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater, an honorary visiting professor of engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru University, and a member of the Indian Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC).\nKak has published on the history of science, the philosophy of science, ancient astronomy, and the history of mathematics. Kak has also published on archaeoastronomy, and advocated the idea of Indigenous Aryans. Many scholars have rejected his theories on these topics in entirety, and his writings have been heavily criticized.\nIn 2019, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for his contributions on the history of mathematics, science, ancient astronomy and philosophy of science.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKak was born to Ram Nath Kak, a government veterinary doctor and Sarojini Kak in Srinagar, India. His brother is the computer scientist Avinash Kak and his sister is the literary theorist Jaishree Odin.\nKak received a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar (now the National Institute of Technology, Srinagar) and a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 1970.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nDuring 1975–1976, Kak was a visiting faculty at Imperial College, London, and a guest researcher at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill. In 1977, he was a visiting researcher at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay. In 1979, he joined Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, where he was appointed the Donald C. and Elaine T. Delaune Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2007, he joined the Computer Science department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater.\nKak proposed an efficient three-layer feed-forward neural network architecture and developed four corner classification algorithms for training it. Despite being criticized for scalability issues; it gained the attention of the electronic hardware community. Kak has argued that there are limits to artificial intelligence and that it cannot match biological intelligence. Kak has been critical of the generalization of the quantum computing to commercial scale; he argues error correction is a significant challenge for scalability although it's fundamental to multi-purpose computing.\nKak is the Regents Professor of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater and an honorary visiting professor of engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is also an honorary visiting professor of media studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nOn 28 August 2018, he was appointed member of the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) in India.\n\n\n== Indology ==\n\n\n=== Indigenous Aryanism ===\nKak primarily advocates for an autochthonous origin of the Indo-Aryans from Punjab (\"Indigenous Aryans\" hypothesis) in contradiction of the scholarly consensus about the validity of Indo-Aryan migration theory; Kak reads the promotion of the latter theory to stem from racist tendencies. Scholars have noted his charges to be without any basis, lacking in any critical examination and primarily intended to promote Hindu supremacy.\n\n\n=== Ancient astronomy in the Rig Veda ===\nKak has also claimed to find evidences of advanced computing and astronomy in the Rig Veda, in what Noretta Koertge deems to be a \"social constructivist and postmodern attack on modern science\". He insists that Vedic scientists discovered the physical laws by Yogic meditation and that it is a valid scientific method which can be only evaluated within the paradigm of Vedic assumptions and by those who have attained Yogic enlightenment. According to Meera Nanda, Kak believes in the superiority of Hindus over Muslims. In a 2004 critique, she summarized some of Kak's views on the matter: according to Kak, Hindus built \"cultural empires\" without military conquest, in contrast to Muslim \"military empires\" reliant on conquest.\n\n\n=== Reviewed works ===\n\n\n==== Archaeoastronomy – The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda ====\nIn the book, Kak proposes that the organization of hymns in the Rig Veda was dictated by an astronomic code concerning the courses of planets—length of solar year and lunar year, the distance between sun and earth et al. He then leverages the proposition to argue for the existence of a tradition of sophisticated observational astronomy as far back as 3000 or 4000 BCE. Kak also states that the construction of fire-altars were a coded representation of their astronomic knowledge and that the Vedic civilisation were aware of the speed of light. He prepared the section on archaeoastronomical sites in India for the thematic study on Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention prepared for UNESCO by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\nWhile Kak's interpretation has been included in recent overviews of astronomy in the Vedic period in India and the West, his chronology and astronomical calculations have been critiqued by several Indologists, such as Michael Witzel, and the noted historian of mathematics Kim Plofker.\nKim Plofker rejected Kak's probabilistic analysis of the presence of planetary period numbers in the Rigveda's hymn number combinations, showing that Kak's apparent matches have \"no statistical significance whatever\". Witzel has rejected his analysis to be suffering from several shortcomings and questioned his usage of arbitrary multiplication factors to lead to the results. Kak's method depends on the structure of the Rigveda as redacted by the shakhas in the late Brahmana period, well within the Indian Iron Age, when it was organized into mandalas (\"books\"). According to Witzel, this leaves Kak's approach attempt to date the text flawed, because this process of redaction took place long after the composition of the individual hymns during the samhita prose period. Witzel concludes that the entire issue boiled down to an over-interpretation of some facts that were internally inconsistent and more, to the creativeness of Kak who was pre-motivated to find evidence of astronomy at every verse of Rig Veda. Meera Nanda criticized the arbitrary and absurd nature of Kak's analysis at length and noted his method to be \"breathtakingly ad hoc\" which \"reads like numerology.\" M A Mehendale, in a review over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, criticized the book for its many shortcomings which did not stand the scrutiny of rigor and remarked it to contain inaccurate and misleading statements. S. G. Dani, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize recipient rejected Kak's hypothesis as unscientific and highly speculative with extremely vague details and whose results were statistically insignificant.\nKlaus Klostermaier in his book A Survey of Hinduism praised Kak, for opening up an \"entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint\". Klostermaier's books have been heavily criticized for offering pro-Hindu views that have little currency in scholarship.\nKak's work influenced Raja Ram Mohan Roy's 1999 book Vedic Physics: Scientific Origin of Hinduism, which sought to prove that the RigVeda was coded per the laws of quantum and particle physics. Kak wrote the foreword to this book commending Roy's interpretations as a new way of looking at Vedic Physics. Meera Nanda, one of Kak's foremost critics, noted the result to be a \"shameful demeaning of physics as well as the Vedas\" and resembling \"ravings of mad men\".\n\n\n==== In Search of the Cradle of Civilization ====\nKak co-authored In Search of the Cradle of Civilization with Georg Feuerstein and David Frawley, equating the Vedic Aryans with the Harappans and thus, participating in the political controversy around the \"Indigenous Aryans\" theory. The chronology espoused in this book is based on the archaeoastronomical readings obtained by correlating textual references and archaeological remains.\nA review by Indian archaeologist M. K. Dhavalikar over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute noted it to be a \"beautifully printed\" contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses, but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained. Guy Beck showered glowing praises on the book in his review over the Yoga Journal. Klostermaier et al. praised the book. Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nEdwin Bryant calls him a well read and articulate spokesman for the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis and for other issues concerning ancient Indian science and culture.\nScholars have rejected his theories in entirety and his writings have been heavily criticized. Acute misrepresentation of facts coupled with wrong observations, extremely flexible and often self-contradictory analysis, cherry picking of data and forwarding of easily disprovable hypotheses have been located. His understanding of linguistics and subsequent assertion have been challenged. Romila Thapar calls Kak an amateur historian whose views on the Indus Civilization were fringe and who was part of a group that had more to do with waging political battles at the excuse of history. Michael Witzel noted him to be a revisionist and part of a \"closely knit, self-adulatory group\", members of which often write together and/or profusely copy from and cite one another, thus rendering the whole scene into a virtually indistinguishable hotchpotch. Garrett G. Fagan, a noted critic of pseudoarchaeology has concurred with Witzel. Meera Nanda writes about Kak being revered as a stalwart of Hindutva and one of the leading \"intellectual Kshatriyas\". Similar concerns of his being a Hindutva-based revisionist have been echoed by other writers. In a critique of faulty scientific reasoning in Hindutva ideologies and theories, Alan Sokal sarcastically criticized Kak as \"one of the leading intellectual luminaries of the Hindu-nationalist diaspora\". Koertge as well as Meera Nanda have remarked that Kak's work advances a Hindutva-based esoteric pseudoscience narrative that seeks to find relatively advanced abstract physics in Vedic texts and assign Indian indigenousness to the Sanskrit-speaking Indic Aryans in a bid to prove the superiority of the ancient Hindu civilization.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology\nNumber theoretic Hilbert transform\nScience wars\nUnary coding\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPublications on Physics and Computer Science in the ArXiv.org e-print archive\nDeccan Chronicle Interview\nTimes of India Interview by Aarti Tikoo Singh"

Previously, he was at Technische Universität Berlin, at University of Colorado Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich. He is a chair of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) conference.\nHochreiter has made contributions in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and bioinformatics, most notably the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, but also in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and biclustering with application to bioinformatics data.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\n\n\n=== Long short-term memory (LSTM) ===\nHochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture in his diploma thesis in 1991 leading to the main publication in 1997. LSTM overcomes the problem of numerical instability in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that prevents them from learning from long sequences (vanishing or exploding gradient). In 2007, Hochreiter and others successfully applied LSTM with an optimized architecture to very fast protein homology detection without requiring a sequence alignment. LSTM networks have also been used in Google Voice for transcription and search, and in the Google Allo chat app for generating response suggestion with low latency.\n\n\n=== Other machine learning contributions ===\nBeyond LSTM, Hochreiter has developed \"Flat Minimum Search\" to increase the generalization of neural networks and introduced rectified factor networks (RFNs) for sparse coding\nwhich have been applied in bioinformatics and genetics. Hochreiter introduced modern Hopfield networks with continuous states and applied them to the task of immune repertoire classification.\nHochreiter worked with Jürgen Schmidhuber in the field of reinforcement learning on actor-critic systems that learn by \"backpropagation through a model\". \nHochreiter has been involved in the development of factor analysis methods with application to bioinformatics, including FABIA for biclustering, HapFABIA for detecting short segments of identity by descent and FARMS for preprocessing and summarizing high-density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays to analyze RNA gene expression. \nIn 2006, Hochreiter and others proposed an extension of the support vector machine (SVM), the \"Potential Support Vector Machine\" (PSVM), which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite.

He is the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBen Green was born on 27 February 1977 in Bristol, England. He studied at local schools in Bristol, Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School, competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1994 and 1995. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995 and completed his BA in mathematics in 1998, winning the Senior Wrangler title. He stayed on for Part III and earned his doctorate under the supervision of Timothy Gowers, with a thesis entitled Topics in arithmetic combinatorics (2003). During his PhD he spent a year as a visiting student at Princeton University. He was a research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge between 2001 and 2005, before becoming a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bristol from January 2005 to September 2006 and then the first Herchel Smith Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge from September 2006 to August 2013. He became the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Oxford on 1 August 2013. He was also a Research Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and held various positions at institutes such as Princeton University, University of British Columbia, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nThe majority of Green's research is in the fields of analytic number theory and additive combinatorics, but he also has results in harmonic analysis and in group theory. His best known theorem, proved jointly with his frequent collaborator Terence Tao, states that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers: this is now known as the Green–Tao theorem.\nAmongst Green's early results in additive combinatorics are an improvement of a result of Jean Bourgain of the size of arithmetic progressions in sumsets, as well as a proof of the Cameron–Erdős conjecture on sum-free sets of natural numbers. He also proved an arithmetic regularity lemma for functions defined on the first \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n natural numbers, somewhat analogous to the Szemerédi regularity lemma for graphs.\nFrom 2004–2010, in joint work with Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler, he developed so-called higher order Fourier analysis. This theory relates Gowers norms with objects known as nilsequences. The theory derives its name from these nilsequences, which play an analogous role to the role that characters play in classical Fourier analysis. Green and Tao used higher order Fourier analysis to present a new method for counting the number of solutions to simultaneous equations in certain sets of integers, including in the primes. This generalises the classical approach using Hardy–Littlewood circle method. Many aspects of this theory, including the quantitative aspects of the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms, are still the subject of ongoing research.\nGreen has also collaborated with Emmanuel Breuillard on topics in group theory. In particular, jointly with Terence Tao, they proved a structure theorem for approximate groups, generalising the Freiman-Ruzsa theorem on sets of integers with small doubling. Green also has worked, jointly with Kevin Ford and Sean Eberhard, on the theory of the symmetric group, in particular on what proportion of its elements fix a set o..."

        "answer": "Braunschweig",
        "context": "Leonhard Wolfgang Bibel (born on 28 October 1938 in Nuremberg) is a German computer scientist, mathematician and Professor emeritus at the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universität Darmstadt. He was one of the founders of the research area of artificial intelligence in Germany and Europe and has been named as one of the ten most important researchers in German artificial intelligence history by the Gesellschaft für Informatik. Bibel established the necessary institutions, conferences and scientific journals and promoted the necessary research programs to establish the field of artificial intelligence.\nBibel has worked in the fields of automated deduction, knowledge representation, architecture of deductive systems and inference, planning, learning, program synthesis, as well as on topics concerning the implications of AI technology for society. His most outstanding scientific contribution was his connection method, which allows logical conclusions to be drawn automatically in a very compact way. Bibel received the 2006 Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWolfgang Bibel was born in Nuremberg, Germany. Before his studies, he had to demonstrate industrial experience, which is why he completed an internship at a large power plant in Franken. Finally, in 1958, he began studying mathematics and physics at the University of Erlangen, majoring in physics. The first year of his studies was a challenge for Bibel, as the content was unknown to him, unlike his fellow students who came from science schools. During his semester breaks, he completed another internship at Siemens-Schuckertwerke. He received his intermediate diploma on May 4, 1961. From 1962 he completed part of his studies at the University of Heidelberg. With the change of his focus to mathematics, he moved to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), where he studied until 1964 and obtained his diploma in mathematics. His diploma thesis dealt with the proof of Remmert's theorem of illustration. From 1964 to 1966, he was then a scientific assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, then headed by Werner Heisenberg. At the Max Planck Institute he met Peter Mittelstaedt, who offered him a scholarship and supervision. Mittelstaedt proposed to Bibel to work on the solution to the problem of reversal in scattering theory for his doctoral thesis but it later became known that the solution had long since been found. At the time, Mittelstaedt had not been aware of this. Later it turned out that Mittelstaedt had accepted a professorship at the University of Cologne. Bibel moved with Mittelstaedt to the University of Cologne, where he worked as a scientific assistant. The solution already found, the suddenly accepted professorship of Mittelstaedt and the distance to his girlfriend led to his resignation after a short time. In 1968 he received his doctorate with cum laude in mathematical logic under the supervision of Kurt Schütte from LMU.\n\n\n=== Habilitation procedure at the Technical University of Munich ===\nFrom 1969 to 1987 he was scientific assistant at the Institute of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Actually, Bibel intended to habilitate at the university. In December 1974 he submitted his habilitation thesis for examination. His supervisor was Klaus Samelson. Surprisingly, however, Friedrich Ludwig Bauer, who headed the institute at the time, vetoed his habilitation, which meant he was denied eligibility, which was unusual given the accomplishments of Bibel. He recommended that he continue his research for another five years before considering a habilitation. Outside of TUM, however, his achievements were recognized, which is why he tried to initiate a habilitation procedure without Bauer's approval, as Bauer vehemently opposed it. During this period, he was appointed as a lecturer by the Department of Computer Science at the Bundeswehr University Munich from 1975 to 1976. In addition, in the summer semester of 1975 he represented the chair of Jacques Loeckx at Saarland University and was called upon by the Dean of the Department of Mathematics/Computer Science of the Paderborn University to apply for a professorship. The chairman of the habilitation commission was Karl Heinz Helwig, who appointed reviewers who had no knowledge of his subject, automated theorem proving. He then turned to the then President of the Technical University of Munich, Ulrich Grigull, but without success. According to Bibel's impression, Grigull said that tradition needed no explanation and that he should have listened to Bauer. During this time, Bibel held further positions and obtained additional opinions, which were positive. These included assessments by Bruno Buchberger and Woody Bledsoe, but in 1977 his application was rejected with 31 dissenting votes and 3 abstentions. Out of desperation, he tried to withdraw the motion. He knew only a few reasons for his rejection from indiscreet discussions. However, he did not get insight into the reasons for the rejection. An application for inspection of documents also failed, which is why he filed a lawsuit, in which he proved errors in the content of the reports. The complaints were dismissed in 1982, as the procedure had been formally correct, so that his habilitation procedure ended after seven proceedings. During this time the attitude of his colleagues towards him changed, which he describes as \"hostile\". In 1978, he applied for another habilitation, as there was a change in the law that allowed senior assistants to take up a professorship. However, this was also rejected in 1980 on the grounds that there was no need in his field. The whole thing Bibel described as an attempt to „[...] academically liquidate“ him and he explained it by saying that Bauer, in his opinion, was obsessed with power and was against Bibel for personal reasons. Bauer and his colleagues rejected the subject and could not identify themselves with Bibel's scientific approach. Bauer was an advocate of imperative programming with ALGOL, while Bibel relied on logic programming with PROLOG. It was not until later that Bauer recognized functional and object-oriented programming with LISP, which was represented by Wolfgang Wahlster. Bauer, in particular, did not believe in the future of the field. At that time, the rejection of artificial intelligence was not only based in Munich, but extended beyond it. Wahlster also described Bauer's approach as driven by ideology. In the same year in which the habilitation failed, the German Research Foundation (DFG), at the request of the Bibel, supported the project \"Use of Evidence Procedures in Programming\". The topic was dominated by the topic of the failed habilitation, which is why Bauer was also outraged about the funding, so that access to the computers of TUM had been blocked. The problem could only be solved with the intervention of the then DFG President. For example, Eickel, who was one of the reviewers and part of Bauer's group, was habilitated, although at the time he only had one publication with three other authors. This approach had led to the fact that large IT companies such as SAP, Software AG and Scheer AG did not emerge from TUM. Andreas von Bechtolsheim was also bored and angry from his studies, which is why he moved to Carnegie Mellon University. The history spread and made his life more difficult. Bauer had a great influence in computer science in Germany at that time. Bibel wrote 26 unsuccessful applications. In the following years Bibel tried to keep his time in Munich to the minimum. The event shaped Bibel and the assessment of Bauer and his colleagues turned out to be wrong.\nIn the academic year 1970/1971, he was Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the computer science section of the Mathematics Department of the Wayne State University in Detroit. In 1985, he was Visiting Associate Professor at the Duke University. He declined offers from the Technische Universität Berlin, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Technische Universität Wien and the University of Ulm.\n\n\n=== Time after TU Munich ===\nIn 1987, he became Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and one year later Adjunct Professor, an honorary title awarded to him by the university, because he then moved to the Technische Universität Darmstadt.\nIn the winter semester 1985/1986, Bibel represented the chair he was later appointed to for the first time. On October 1, 1988 he became Professor of Intellectics at then Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universität Darmstadt. At this time Bibel was already 50. The TU Darmstadt was the 16th employer and also the last of Bibel. It was also the first stable and appropriate working environment for Bibel. For the academic year 1991/1992 he took over the office as Dean of the Department of Computer Science of the TU Darmstadt. During this time he led three appointment commissions. Among them were Oskar von Stryk and Karsten Weihe. In his time, he also built up his research group and made the TU Darmstadt one of the leading universities for artificial intelligence worldwide. The most outstanding scientific project was the National Priority Programme Deduction, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence. He has been Professor emeritus since 2004.\nAt the request of Bibel, Wolfgang Wahlster received his first honorary doctorate from the TU Darmstadt and John Alan Robinson the Humboldt Prize in 1994, which included a six-month stay at the Technical University of Darmstadt. By 2017, twenty-five of his doctoral students or staff were professors. He worked as Section Editor of the journal Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n== Contribution to Artificial Intelligence in Germany and Europe ==\nContrary to the difficulties at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), he continued his research in his field. The year 1975 can be regarded as the starting shot for artificial intelligence in Germany. Gerd Veenker called a meeting in Bonn in which Wolfgang Bibel and Wolfgang Wahlster also took part. As a result of the meeting they established the newsletter KI, which later became the magazine KI. The first six issues were issued by Hans-Hellmut Nagel. From the seventh issue onwards, Bibel took over for two years until 1998. During this time he received no support from TUM, so he had to do all the work. At the meeting it was also decided to set up a subcommittee for artificial intelligence in the technical committee Cognitive Systems in the Gesellschaft für Informatik, to which Bibel belonged as a member since 1975. The chairman was Hans-Hellmut Nagel, who at that time was the only professor on the highest level who confessed to artificial intelligence. This committee coordinated the establishment of artificial intelligence as a scientific discipline in Germany. Later, Bibel took over the role. He also held this position for the longest time. In 1975, he organized a workshop on automatic evidence, which was internationally acclaimed in science and business. The workshop was a precursor to today's German Conference on Artificial Intelligence. In 1982, together with Jörg Siekmann, he founded the two-week KI Spring School (KIFS), as the research results had not yet reached the students. This resulted in one of the first books on artificial intelligence in Germany, which brought students closer to the topic. Today the school is a permanent institution. In 1985 he also offered the first Advanced Course on AI (ACAI), the equivalent of the KIFS for Europe. This also resulted in another book. Bibel wanted to found a European organisation for artificial intelligence as early as 1979. 1982 saw the first European Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the founding of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence, today's European Association for Artificial Intelligence  (EurAI). He became its first president. During the whole time he had no professorship and no support from TUM, because they refused it.\nIn 1975, the German Research Foundation (DFG) approved Bibel an application for a research grant. Bibel also procured several research projects for the TU Darmstadt, including the national priority program Deduction, which was approved in autumn 1991. The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence.\nAt the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in 1977, he presented with Nagel for the first time the situation of artificial intelligence in Germany. From 1986 to 1992 he was a member of the board of directors of IJCAI and from 1987 to 1989 its president. Bibel's influence at that time also led Japan to launch a research program for a whole decade, the Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS). The research programme caused a great stir, which is why personalities from the world of politics attended the conference in Japan in 1979. Bibel represented Germany at the conference. The conference was followed by other major research programmes such as the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology and the Information Technology Programme funded by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT).\nIn 1984 Bibel turned to Franz-Josef Strauss to point out the growing importance of artificial intelligence. This led to the foundation of a Bavarian Research Center for Knowledge-Based Systems (BayWiss) in 1988. At the same time, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence was founded and the Institute for Application-Oriented Knowledge Processing (IAW) was established in Baden-Wuerttemberg.\nOn April 23, 2018, he initiated the events that led to the launch of the CLAIRE (Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe) initiative.\n\n\n== Positions ==\nWolfgang Bibel argued that the study of artificial intelligence should rather be called Intellectics.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nFirst German Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, 1990\nFellow of the Canadian Institutes for Advanced Research\nOne of the ten most important researchers in the German artificial intelligence history by the Gesellschaft für Informatik\nFellow of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence\nFellow of the Gesellschaft für Informatik, 2006\nInternational Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence Donald E.

Shaw & Co., a hedge fund company which was once described by Fortune magazine as \"the most intriguing and mysterious force on Wall Street\". A former assistant professor in the computer science department at Columbia University, Shaw made his fortune exploiting inefficiencies in financial markets with the help of state-of-the-art high speed computer networks. In 1996, Fortune magazine referred to him as \"King Quant\" because of his firm's pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. In 2001, Shaw turned to full-time scientific research in computational biochemistry, more specifically molecular dynamics simulations of proteins.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nShaw was raised in Los Angeles, California. His father was a theoretical physicist who specialised in plasma and fluid flows, and his mother is an artist and educator. They divorced when he was 12. His stepfather, Irving Pfeffer, was professor of finance at University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of papers supporting the efficient market hypothesis.\nShaw earned a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego, double majoring in mathematics & applied physics and information science. He went on to earn a MSc and PhD from Stanford University in 1980, and then became an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Columbia University. While at Columbia, Shaw conducted research in massively parallel computing with the NON-VON supercomputer. This supercomputer was composed of processing elements in a tree structure meant to be used for fast relational database searches. Earlier in his career, he founded Stanford Systems Corporation.\n\n\n== Investment career ==\nIn 1986, he joined Morgan Stanley, as Vice President for Technology in Nunzio Tartaglia's automated proprietary trading group. In 1994, Shaw was appointed by President Clinton to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, where he was chairman of the Panel on Educational Technology. In 2000, he was elected to the board of directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science served as its treasurer 2000–2010. In 2007, Shaw was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was appointed by President Obama again to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. In 2012, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and in 2014 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n=== D. E. Shaw ===\nIn 1988 he started his own hedge fund, D. E. Shaw & Co, which employed proprietary algorithms for securities trading. In 2018, Forbes estimated his net worth at $6.2 billion. He is also a senior research fellow at the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Columbia University, and an adjunct professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia's medical school. Shaw is chief scientist of D. E. Shaw Research, which conducts interdisciplinary research in the field of computational biochemistry.\nAccording to the Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine's annual ranking for 2014, D. E. Shaw, who made $530 million in 2014, and  James H. Simons of Renaissance Technologies who made $1.2 billion were among the top 25 earners in the hedge fund industry. They are both \"quantitative strategists who founded firms that build algorithms for trading.\"\n\n\n== Political and philanthropic donations ==\nShaw has donated US$2.25 million to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and $1 million to Organizing for Action.\nThrough the Shaw Family Endowment Fund, by 2014 he and his wife have donated $400,000 to the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, $400,000 to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and $800,000 to the Horace Mann School. From 2011 to 2017, the Fund annually donated $1 million to Yale University, Stanford University, Harvard University, Princeton University, and $500,000 to Columbia University and Brown University. The college donations represent over 60% of the Fund's philanthropy. Shaw was on the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShaw married personal finance commentator and journalist Beth Kobliner in 1993. Shaw is Jewish and he and his wife are members of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York. They have two sons and a daughter, and live in New York City.

He is a recipient of the Nevanlinna Prize by the International Mathematical Union.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJon Kleinberg was born in 1971 in Boston, Massachusetts to a mathematics professor father and a computer consultant mother. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Cornell University in 1993 and a PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996. He is the older brother of fellow Cornell computer scientist Robert Kleinberg.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince 1996 Kleinberg has been a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell, as well as a visiting scientist at IBM's Almaden Research Center. His work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and grants from Google, Yahoo!, and the NSF. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2011, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 2013 he became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n\n== Research ==\nKleinberg is best known for his work on networks. One of his best-known contributions is the HITS algorithm, developed while he was at IBM.  HITS is an algorithm for web search that builds on the eigenvector-based methods used in algorithms and served as the full-scale model for PageRank by recognizing that web pages or sites should be considered important not only if they are linked to by many others (as in PageRank), but also if they link to many others.  Search engines themselves are examples of sites that are important because they link to many others.  Kleinberg realized that this generalization implies two different classes of important web pages, which he called \"hubs\" and \"authorities\".  The HITS algorithm is an algorithm for automatically identifying the leading hubs and authorities in a network of hyperlinked pages.\nKleinberg is also known for his work on algorithmic aspects of the small world experiment.  He was one of the first to realize that Stanley Milgram's famous \"six degrees\" letter-passing experiment implied not only that there are short paths between individuals in social networks but also that people seem to be good at finding those paths, an apparently simple observation that turns out to have profound implications for the structure of the networks in question. The formal model in which Kleinberg studied this question is a two dimensional grid, where each node has both short-range connections (edges) to neighbours in the grid and long-range connections to nodes further apart. For each node v, a long-range edge between v and another node w is added with a probability that decays as the second power of the distance between v and w. This is generalized to a d-dimensional grid, where the probability decays as the d-th power of the distance.\nKleinberg has written numerous papers and articles as well as a textbook on computer algorithms, Algorithm Design, co-authored the first edition with Éva Tardos and sole authored the second edition.  Among other honors, he received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship also known as the \"genius grant\" in 2005 and the Nevanlinna Prize in 2006, an award that is given out once every four years along with the Fields Medal as the premier distinction in Computational Mathematics.\nHis new book is entitled \"Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World\", published by Cambridge University Press in 2010.\nCornell's Association of Computer Science Undergraduates awarded him the \"Faculty of the Year\" award in 2002.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStill the Rebel King -Video\nInterview with Jon Kleinberg, ACM Infosys Foundation Award recipient by Stephen Ibaraki\nYury Lifshits, Four Results of Jon Kleinberg: a talk for St. Petersburg Mathematical Society"

        "answer": "George Mason University",
        "context": "Author: A. Jefferson Offutt\nAffiliation: George Mason University\nNumerical metrics:\n- hIndex: 32\n- i10Index: 48\n- Authors_Cited by count: 5390\n- Authors_Works count: 68\n- Two-year mean citedness: 0.0\n\nInstitution: George Mason University\nType: education\nLocation: US\nNumerical metrics:\n- Institution_Cited by count: 1125234\n- Institution_Works count: 55575\nHomepage: https://www.gmu.edu/\n\nAdditional information: Andrew Jefferson Offutt V (August 16, 1934 – April 30, 2013) was an American science fiction, fantasy, and erotic fiction author. He wrote as Andrew J. Offutt, A. J. Offutt, and Andy Offutt. His normal byline, andrew j. offutt, has all his name in lower-case letters. His erotica appeared under seventeen different pseudonyms, principally John Cleve, John Denis, Jeff Morehead, and Turk Winter.\n\nThe Sword of Skelos (1979), one of Offutt's contributions to the Conan The Barbarian saga, included a short, facetious biographical note: \"Andrew J. Offutt is the recently 'tired and re-tired', as he puts it, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He loves heroic fantasy though at 6' 1\" he is built for speed, not combat. Kentuckian  Offutt has a number of other books in and out of print, and has been a helpless fan of Robert E. Howard since birth. Now he calls himself the Steve Garvey among writers; 'Surely it's every boy's dream to grow up—but not too much—and get to write about Conan'. Offutt researches with gusto, both in and out of books, having—briefly and painfully, he says—worn chainmail and helm and wielded sword. He is also tired of aged, bald, ugly, sexless mages and squeaky females in heroic fantasy\".\n\n\n== Life and family ==\nOffutt was born in a log cabin near Taylorsville, Kentucky. He was married for more than 50 years to Jodie McCabe Offutt of Lexington, Kentucky. They had four children: writer Chris Offutt; Jeff Offutt, Professor of Software Engineering at George Mason University; Scotty Hyde, copy editor for the Park City Daily News in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Melissa Offutt, a sales executive for Sprint in San Diego. Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.\n\n\n== Career in speculative fiction ==\n\nOffutt began publishing in 1954 with the story \"And Gone Tomorrow\" in the If.  Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story \"Blacksword\" to Galaxy in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it \"embarrassingly amateur\".\nOffutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the \"Thieves World\" series edited by Robert Asprin and Lynn Abbey, which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as Shadowspawn (and, later, Chance).  His \"Iron Lords\" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by Robert E. Howard. There was a series on Howard's best known character, Conan, and another one on the less known Cormac mac Art—an Irish Viking active in King Arthur's time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.\nAs \"John Cleve\", Offutt also wrote the 19-book erotic science fiction series \"Spaceways\", over half of which were collaborations.\nAs an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled Swords Against Darkness, which included the first professional sale by Charles de Lint. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA).\n\n\n== Career in erotica ==\nOffutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, \"Anonymous,\" Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux, John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winte..."

        "answer": "Indian Statistical Institute",
        "context": "Sankar Kumar Pal (born 1950) is a computer scientist and the president (and former director) of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata. He is also a National Science Chair, Government of India. Pal is a computer scientist with an international reputation on pattern recognition, image processing, fuzzy neural network, rough fuzzy hybridization, soft computing, granular mining, and machine intelligence. He pioneered the development of fuzzy set theory, and neuro-fuzzy and rough-fuzzy computing for uncertainty modelling with demonstration in pattern recognition, image processing, machine learning, knowledge-based systems and data mining. Pal is widely recognized across the world for his pioneering and extraordinary contributions in Machine Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition. This has made India a leader in these disciplines in international scenario. He founded the Machine Intelligence Unit in 1993, and the Center for Soft Computing Research: A National Facility (the first of its kind in the country) in 2004, both at the ISI. In the process he has created many renowned scientists out of his doctoral students.\nHe is a recipient of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in 1990. He was awarded Padma Shri in Science and Engineering on 5 April 2013 by the President of India Pranab Mukherjee in recognition of his work in machine intelligence.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nSK Pal studied at the University of Calcutta for his BSc in physics (1969), and BTech (1972) and MTech (1974) in radio physics and electronics. \nHe received a PhD in radio physics and electronics from the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta in 1979 as a student of Indian Statistical Institute, and another PhD in electrical engineering along with Diploma of the Imperial College from Imperial College, University of London, in 1982. After completing PhD at Imperial College, London as a Commonwealth Scholar, he did post-doctoral research there during 1982 to 1983 as a UK Medical Research Council Fellow. Subsequently, he worked at the University of California, Berkeley and University of Maryland, College Park from 1986 to 1987 as a Fulbright Fellow; at the NASA Johnson Space Center from 1990 to 1992 & in 1994 as a US National Academy of Science-National Research Council Senior Resident Research Associate; and at the US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. in 2004 as a visiting scientist. Besides, he had been a Distinguished Visitor of IEEE Computer Society (USA) for Asia-Pacific Region since 1997, and held several visiting positions in Australia, Poland, Italy, France, New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong universities. He established sustained research collaborations with many foreign universities, particularly in Europe such as the Warsaw University, Poland (1997-2017), Naples University, Italy (2004-2020) and INSEAD, France (2001-2013) under joint agreements between Nations or Institutes, and Hong Kong Poly University, Hong Kong, China (1999-2008).\nPal joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, as a CSIR Senior Research Fellow in 1975, and eventually entered into full professor position in 1987. He then became a distinguished scientist in 1998, the director in 2005, and the president in 2022. He was the first computer scientist as well as someone outside statistics and mathematics to become the director of ISI in its 75-year history. He is also the first ex-employee of ISI being elected to hold the honorable chair of President of ISI since its inception in 1931.\nHis areas of research interests  include pattern recognition, machine intelligence, image processing, data mining, granular computing, fuzzy sets and uncertainty analysis, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, rough sets, and soft computing with applications such as in bioinformatics, video analytics, online social network analysis, and cognitive mind development. He has pioneered hybrid intelligent systems like neuro fuzzy and rough fuzzy hybridization. The generic families of such hybrid intelligent models (networks) developed (in early 1990s) not only provide enhanced learning, understandability, knowledge mining and uncertainty management in decision-making, but also can explain the network decision in natural language. Rough-fuzzy hybridization further enables mining linguistic, categorical and relational data. The neural models, capable of accepting linguistic input, constitute the basic modules that laid the foundation of neuro-fuzzy computing and later, soft computing. Augmentation of the original definition of soft computing by introducing rough sets as its fifth constituent is another contribution of his research. This enhances greatly the computational intelligence of soft computing methodologies. All these have led to significant synergistic technological developments in modern AI (including explainable AI) and data science. His image processing research in 1970s is perhaps the first investigation (other pioneer being A. Rosenfeld, UMD, College Park, USA) that brings out the root relation between the abstract concept of fuzzy sets and image processing basic tasks like image enhancement, edge detection, primitive extraction and segmentation, and the associated uncertainties involved. Subsequently, definitions for image entropy (mid 1980s) and generalized rough-fuzzy entropy (mid 2000s) based on logarithmic and exponential gain functions are provided for modelling the uncertainty. These measures are unique. This fundamental work laid the foundation of fuzzy (soft) image processing and computer vision research. His other highly cited original research include: i) Unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm (in early 2000s) producing maximally independent features, that results in fast and superior performance and is suitable for Big data, ii) Granular computing concept and decision-making models (introduced since early 2000s) particularly when samples are indiscernible, where computations are performed using information granules rather than individual samples; thereby providing gain in both performance and computation time in mining tasks including deep learning, and iii) Z*-number, developed in mid 2010s, for machine subjectivity representation in machine-mind development by encapsulating the objective and subjective time, context, and affect components in natural language of thoughts, speech, and texts. \nPal is widely recognized across the world for his pioneering and exemplary contributions in machine intelligence, fuzzy logic, soft computing and pattern recognition. This has made India a big leader in these disciplines in international scenario. \nHe is a co-author of twenty-one books, eighteen conference proceedings, about five hundred research publications, and two US patents. He has served/serving as editor in most of the well-known scientific journals in computer science and engineering (~25 international journals). He visited more than forty countries as a Keynote/ Invited speaker or academic visitor. He has co-authored with researchers from 48 foreign and 16 Indian institutes.\nAccording to Google Scholar, Pal's work had been cited more than 37,000 times with h-index of 85. One of his articles based on the work done in India is cited 5800+ times; which is noteworthy.\nPal is the scientist who introduced the Soft Computing concept and research in India.\nFor his outstanding contributions, the Department of Science and Technology, GoI, established under his leadership the Center for Soft Computing Research (CSCR), first in Asia, in 2004 at ISI, Kolkata. Subsequently, CSCR is declared by the Governing Body of ISI as an Associate Institute of ISI in 2010. Apart from acting as a strong base for nationwide research and training with linkage to industries and premier institutes in India and abroad, CSCR had special provision for funding and mentoring less endowed institutions, including those in North-East regions of India. \nMachine Intelligence Unit (MIU) founded by him in 1993 at ISI, Kolkata has now turned out to be an internationally recognized leading research school producing many science leaders. These demonstrate his visionary leadership.\nIt is during Pal's directorship of ISI (2005-2010), when the birthday of Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was declared by the Prime Minister of India on 24 Dec 2006, as the “National Statistics Day” to be celebrated every year over the country. Further, establishing the ISI-Chennai Center, approving the ISI-North Eastern Center, and replacing UGC-pay scales by higher IISc-pay scales for faculty at ISI, are some other major achievements under his visionary leadership as Director of ISI.\nPal is the founder president of the Indian National Academy of Engineering, Kolkata Chapter.\nBiennial International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI), started in 2005, is his another brainchild. This facilitates regular interaction among Indian researchers with international experts in AI, ML and related areas for advancing science & technology.\nAll these activities, including foundation of MIU & CSCR and visionary leadership as ISI-Director, have long lasting educational and societal impact.\nSK Pal has graduated officially 22 PhD students, so far, in India and abroad. It is not the number, but the quality which was his only concern. Many of his PhDs are now internationally known leading scientists with recognitions like Fellows of IEEE, TWAS, IFSA, INSA, INAE, J.C. Bose National Fellow, Padma Shri, S.S. Bhatnagar awardee, P.C. Mahalanobis National Award of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI), Govt. of India, Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transaction, Vice-President of Multinational IT Company, and Directors of premier national Institutes.\nPersons to acknowledge among others: Prof. Dwijesh Dutta Majumder (PhD supervisor at ISI Calcutta), Dr. Robert A.

He has been a Fellow of Keble College, Oxford, since 1985 and was elected a foreign associate member of the French Academy of Sciences in 2015. He was formerly BP Professor of Information Engineering at Oxford from 1985 to 2010 and a senior research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 1980 to 1985.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBrady was educated in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, where he was awarded a first class Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1966 followed by a Master of Science degree in 1968. He went on to study at the Australian National University, where he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1970 for research into group theory supervised by László György Kovács.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nBrady is an authority in the field of image analysis, initially working on shape analysis while at MIT, then on robotics, but most of all with an emphasis on medical image analysis. At MIT he worked on: the multiscale representation of the bounding contours of shapes (the curvature primal sketch), with Haruo Asada (Toshiba); two dimensional shapes (smoothed local symmetries), with Jon Connell; and the application of differential geometry to three-dimensional data, with Jean Ponce and Demetri Terzopoulos. He also worked on texture with Alan Yuille. He also worked with John M. Hollerbach, Tomàs Lozano-Pérez, and Matt Mason on robotics, who together published an early influential collection of articles and founded a seminal series of conferences.\nArriving in Oxford in 1985, he established the Robotics Laboratory and recruited Andrew Blake, Andrew Zisserman, Stephen Cameron, Hugh Durrant-Whyte, Lionel Tarassenko, Alison Noble, and David Murray. His initial focus was on mobile robotics, where he worked closely with Huosheng Hu Jan Grothusen, Stephen Smith, Mark Jenkinson, and Ian Reid. This was a collaboration with GEC Electrical Products and led in 1991 to the formation of Guidance Navigation Systems Ltd.  The primary interest of this work was sensor data fusion and the real-time detection of obstacles in a robot vehicle's planned path, leading to a “slalom” manoeuvre to avoid it, or, if this was judged infeasible by the robot, a complete re-planning of the path to the goal.\n\nFinishing a spell as head of engineering science (1989–84), Brady was awarded an EPSRC Senior Fellowship, during which he spent two year-long periods in the INRIA Laboratory headed by Nicholas Ayache.  Brady had begun to switch from robotics to medical imaging, specifically breast cancer, in 1989, following the death of his mother-in-law Dr. Irene Friedlander from the disease.  For the past 29 years he has worked with Ralph Highnam, first supervising Ralph's thesis, then co-authoring a monograph Mammographic Image Analysis, then co-founding Mirada Solutions Ltd and subsequently Volpara Health Technologies (ASX: VHT).  Together, they developed an influential mathematical model of the fluence of X-rays through the female breast as a basis for analysis of mammographic images. This work was done in collaboration with Ralph Highnam and pioneered an entirely novel “physics-based” approach. This attracted the interest of Nico Karssemeijer and led to further collaborations and the company ScreenPoint bv co-founded by Mike and Nico.\nBrady is the ..."

As of March 2006, he is a senior research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Florida.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHayes was educated at the Bentley Grammar School, Calne. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in artificial intelligence on the topic of 'Semantic trees: New foundations for automatic theorem-proving'  from the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nHayes has been an active, prolific, and influential figure in artificial intelligence for over five decades. He has a reputation for being provocative but also quite humorous. \nOne of his earliest publications, with John McCarthy, was the first thorough statement of the basis for the AI field of logical knowledge representation, introducing the notion of situation calculus, representation and reasoning about time, fluents, and the use of logic for representing knowledge in a computer.\nHayes next major contribution was the seminal work on the Naive Physics Manifesto, which anticipated the expert systems movement in many ways \nand called for researchers in AI to actually try to represent knowledge in computers. Although not the first to mention the word \"ontology\" in computer science (that distinction belongs to John McCarthy ), Hayes was one of the first to actually do it, and inspired an entire generation of researchers in knowledge engineering, logical formalisations of commonsense reasoning, and ontology.\nIn the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument \"disproving\" the possibility of AI. The Newcomb Awards are announced in the AI Magazine published by AAAI.\nAt the turn of the century he became active in the Semantic Web community, contributing substantially (perhaps solely) to the revised semantics of RDF known as RDF-Core, one of the three designers (along with Peter Patel-Schneider and Ian Horrocks) of the Web Ontology Language semantics, and most recently contributed to SPARQL.  He is also, along with philosopher Christopher Menzel the primary designer of the ISO Common Logic standard.\nHayes has served as secretary of AISB, chairman and trustee of IJCAI, associate editor of Artificial Intelligence, a governor of the Cognitive Science Society and president of American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Hayes is a charter Fellow of AAAI and of the Cognitive Science Society\nAccording to his website, his current research interests include \"knowledge representation and automatic reasoning, especially the representation of space and time; the semantic web; ontology design; and the philosophical foundations of AI and computer science\".\n\n\n== References ==..."

        "question": "In which year did the writer of 'Expertise at Our Fingertips' hold a post-doctoral fellowship at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research?",
        "answer": "1971",
        "context": "The theory of the least objectionable program (LOP) is a mediological theory explaining television audience behavior. It was developed in the 1960s by then executive of audience measurement at NBC, Paul L. Klein, who was greatly influenced by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media.\n\n\n== \"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\" ==\nIn an article \"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\" (published in TV Guide in 1971), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of television rather than television shows, treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast.\nThis is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to \"watch television\", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find \"something they like\" – because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like – but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel.\n(Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.)\nThus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, \"disturbing their reverie\" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, cliché, \"instantly familiar,\" predictable, and monotonous in tone.\n\n\n== Least offensive programming ==\nLeast offensive programming (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) was a strategy employed mainly by major US television networks, approximately from the 1940s to late 1970s, where viewer numbers were thought to be sustained by television programming that offended the fewest viewers.  The result was an often mass-produced, bland output of popular culture focused on leisure, targeting the American middle class. The theory was popularized by Klein.\n\n\n=== Examples of LOP guidelines ===\nFairly positive images of a show\nCan deal with serious issues but still needs to be upbeat\nLikeable characters\nLack of controversy\nRemember the dynamics of TV today\n\n\n== List of shows as LOP ==\nNCIS: New Orleans\nMadam Secretary\nScorpion\nGrace Under Fire\nJust Shoot Me\nMurphy Brown\nRoseanne\n\n\n== Obsolescence of the theory ==\nIt has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high quality shows, top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of DVDs and Netflix.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLorrie Faith Cranor, Shane M.

        "answer": "November 27, 1953",
        "context": "Stephen Kevin Bannon (born November 27, 1953) is an American media executive, political strategist, and former investment banker. He served as the White House's chief strategist for the first seven months of U.S. president Donald Trump's administration, before Trump discharged him. He is a former executive chairman of Breitbart News and previously served on the board of the now-defunct data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.\nBannon was an officer in the United States Navy from 1977 to 1983, after which he worked for two years at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. In 1993, he became acting director of the research project Biosphere 2. He was an executive producer on 18 Hollywood films from 1991 to 2016. In 2007, he co-founded Breitbart News, a website which he described in 2016 as \"the platform for the alt-right\".\nIn 2016, Bannon became the chief executive officer of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was appointed chief strategist and senior Counselor to the President following Trump's election. He left the position eight months later and rejoined Breitbart. In January 2018, after his criticism of Trump's children was reported in Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, he was disavowed by Trump and subsequently left Breitbart.\nAfter leaving the White House, Bannon opposed the Republican Party establishment and supported insurgent candidates in Republican primary elections. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned when former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, despite Bannon's support, lost the 2017 United States Senate election in Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones. Bannon had declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement\". Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world, including creating a network of far-right groups in Europe.\nIn August 2020, Bannon and three others were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering in connection with the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign. According to the grand jury indictment, Bannon and the defendants promised that all contributions would go to building a U.S.–Mexico border wall, but instead enriched themselves. Bannon pleaded not guilty. On January 20, 2021, on his last day in office, Trump pardoned Bannon, sparing him from a federal trial. Federal pardons do not cover state offenses, and in September 2022, Bannon was charged in New York state court on counts of fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy in connection with the campaign.\nBannon refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, the U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the 2021 United States Capitol attack. He was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury on two criminal charges of contempt of Congress. In July 2022, he was convicted on both counts in a jury trial. He was sentenced in October 2022 to four months in prison and a $6,500 fine. After losing his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Bannon surrendered to a federal prison in Connecticut on July 1, 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nStephen Kevin Bannon was born November 27, 1953, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Doris (née Herr), a homemaker, and Martin J. Bannon Jr., who worked as an AT&T telephone lineman and as a middle manager. He grew up in a working-class family that was pro-Kennedy and pro-union Democrat. He is of Irish and German descent. Much of his mother's side of the family settled in the Baltimore area. Bannon graduated from Benedictine College Preparatory, a private, Catholic, military high school in Richmond, Virginia, in 1971, and then attended Virginia Tech, where he served as the president of the student government association. During the summers he worked at a local junkyard.\nIn 1976, he graduated from Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies with a bachelor's degree in urban planning. While serving in the navy, he earned a master's degree in national security studies in 1983 from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. In 1985, Bannon earned a Master of Business Administration degree with honors from Harvard Business School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== U.S. Navy ===\nBannon was an officer in the United States Navy from 1977 to 1983; he served on the destroyer USS Paul F. Foster as a surface warfare officer in the Pacific Fleet, and afterwards as a special assistant to the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon. Bannon's job at the Pentagon was, among other things, handling messages between senior officers and writing reports about the state of the Navy fleet worldwide. While at the Pentagon, Bannon attended Georgetown University at night and obtained his master's degree in national security studies.\n\nIn 1980, Bannon was deployed to the Persian Gulf to assist with Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis. In a 2015 interview, Bannon said that the mission's failure marked a turning point in his political worldview from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks. He recounted,\"I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter fucked things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that [George W.] Bush had fucked up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\"\n\n\n=== Investment banking ===\nAfter his military service, Bannon worked at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker in the Mergers and Acquisitions Department. In 1987, he relocated from New York to Los Angeles, to assist Goldman in expanding their presence in the entertainment industry. He stayed at this position with Goldman in Los Angeles for two years, and left with the title of vice president.\n\n\n=== Media and investing ===\nIn 1990, Bannon and several colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched their own company Bannon & Co., a boutique investment bank specializing in media. In one of Bannon & Co.'s transactions, the firm represented Westinghouse Electric, which wanted to sell Castle Rock Entertainment. Bannon negotiated a sale of Castle Rock to Turner Broadcasting System, which was owned by Ted Turner at the time. Instead of a full adviser's fee, Bannon & Co. accepted a financial stake in five television shows, including Seinfeld, which was in its third season. Bannon still receives cash residuals each time Seinfeld is aired. In 1998, Société Générale purchased Bannon & Co.\n\n\n=== Earth science ===\nIn 1993, while still managing Bannon & Co., Bannon became acting director of the earth science research project Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona. Under Bannon, the closed-system experiment project shifted emphasis from researching human space exploration and colonization toward the scientific study of earth's environment, pollution, and climate change. He left the project in 1995.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and media ===\n\nIn the 1990s, Bannon ventured into entertainment and media and became a Hollywood film and media executive producer. Bannon produced 18 films, including Sean Penn's drama The Indian Runner (1991), and Julie Taymor's film Titus (1999). Bannon became a partner with entertainment industry executive Jeff Kwatinetz at film and television management company The Firm, Inc., where he served in 2002 and 2003.\nIn 2004, Bannon made a documentary about Ronald Reagan, In the Face of Evil. While making and screening the film, Bannon met Reagan's War author Peter Schweizer and publisher Andrew Breitbart, who described him as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement. Other films Bannon financed and produced include Fire from the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman (2010), The Undefeated (2011), and Occupy Unmasked (2012).\nIn 2006, Bannon persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest in a company known as Internet Gaming Entertainment. Following a lawsuit, the company rebranded as Affinity Media, and Bannon took over as CEO. From 2007 through 2011, Bannon was the chair and CEO of Affinity Media.\nIn 2007, Bannon wrote an eight-page treatment for another documentary, Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism (sic) in America. The outline states, \"although driven by the 'best intentions,' institutions such as the media, the Jewish community and government agencies were appeasing jihadists aiming to create an Islamic republic.\" In 2011, Bannon spoke at the Liberty Restoration Foundation in Orlando, Florida, about the economic crisis of 2008, the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and their impact in the origins of the Tea Party movement, and his films Generation Zero (2010) and The Undefeated.\n\n\n==== Breitbart News ====\n\nIn 2007, Bannon was a founding board member of Breitbart News, a far-right news, opinion and commentary website. Philip Elliott and Zeke J. Miller of Time have said that the site has \"pushed racist, sexist, xenophobic and antisemitic material into the vein of the alternative right\". Bannon said that Breitbart's ideological mix included libertarians, Zionists, the conservative gay community, same-sex marriage opponents, economic nationalists, populists, as well as the alt-right, with the alt-right comprising a very small proportion overall. Conceding the alt-right holds views with \"racial and anti-Semitic overtones\", Bannon said he has zero tolerance for such views.\nIn March 2012, following the death of Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart, Bannon became executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC, the parent company of Breitbart News. Under his leadership, Breitbart's editorial tone became more nationalistic, and also became increasingly friendly to the alt-right. In 2016, Bannon declared the website \"the platform for the alt-right\". Speaking about his role at Breitbart, Bannon said, \"We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class.\" Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor and colleague of Bannon, called Bannon a \"'bully' who 'sold out [Breitbart founder] Andrew's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.'\"\nOn August 18, 2017, Breitbart announced that Bannon would return as executive chairman following his period of employment at the White House. Because of the break with Trump, Bannon's position as head of Breitbart News was called into question by Breitbart's owners. On January 9, 2018, five months after his appointment, he stepped down as executive chairman. The billionaire funders of Breitbart, Robert and Rebekah Mercer, reportedly decided to push Bannon out from Breitbart, in part because of his break with Trump and in part because they had become weary of Bannon's \"impulsive and attention-seeking antics\" and Bannon's expenditures on \"travel and private security\".\nBannon hosted a radio show, Breitbart News Daily, on the SiriusXM Patriot satellite radio channel.\n\n\n==== Other media activities ====\nIn 2005, Bannon secured $60 million in funding from Goldman Sachs and other investors for Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE), a company based in Hong Kong that employed \"low-wage Chinese workers\" to play World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, to earn gold in-game that could be traded for virtual items, which could then be sold to players of the video game for real money.\nWhile some gamers liked IGE's offers of World of Warcraft money that would typically take hours to farm, other gamers called it cheating. Many gamers responded by posting anti-Chinese vitriol. Blizzard Entertainment, the video game's owners, eventually shut down accounts used by gold farmers. IGE was also the target of a class action lawsuit by a player who said IGE's practices were \"substantially impairing\" people's enjoyment of the game.\nWhile IGE's business model failed, Bannon became interested in the game's online community, describing its members as \"rootless white males, [who] had monster power\". Through Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, whom Bannon recruited, Bannon realized that he could \"activate that army\" of gamers and Internet trolls, adding, \"They c[a]me in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.\"\nSince 2019, Bannon has hosted Bannon's War Room on Robert J. Sigg's Real America's Voice television network, podcast platforms, and radio.\n\n\n=== Government Accountability Institute ===\n\nBannon was executive chair and co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization where he helped orchestrate the publication of Breitbart News senior Editor-at-large Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash, from its founding in 2012 until his departure in August 2016. The organization creates fact-based indictments against politicians using the deep web, tax filings, flight logs, and foreign government documents and then forwards their findings to the media. The organization is registered as nonpartisan but it mainly investigates alleged corruption, crony capitalism, and misuse of taxpayer money within the Democratic Party. The group has spread conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. For the years 2012 through 2015, he received between $81,000 and $100,000 each year; the organization reported that he worked an average of 30 hours per week for the organization.\n\n\n=== Cambridge Analytica ===\n\nBannon served as vice president of the board of Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm owned largely by the Mercer family, who also co-owns Breitbart News; the firm allegedly used illegal tactics to target American voters in the 2016 election. According to former Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, Bannon oversaw the collection of Facebook data which was used to target American voters. Wylie who helped with creation of the company referred to the company as a \"psychological warfare tool\". Bannon was paid more than $125,000 for his work at Cambridge Analytica. Bannon's stake in Cambridge Analytica was estimated at $1–5 million, but he sold his stake in the company once he joined the Trump administration in April 2017.\n\n\n=== The Movement ===\n\nIn 2017, Bannon founded the Movement, a populist organization which frequently promotes right wing populist groups in Europe which are against the EU government and political system in Europe. The group is also known for its opposition to George Soros's Open Society Foundations, Bannon has referred to Soros as \"evil but brilliant\". The organization employees 10 full time staff members. Mischaël Modrikamen, the leader of the Belgian People's Party, serves as executive director. The organization has received praise from figures like Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Italian Eurosceptic party M5S leader Luigi Di Maio.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ===\n\nOn August 17, 2016, with 88 days until the 2016 presidential election, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Bannon left Breitbart, the Government Accountability Institute and Cambridge Analytica, to take the job. Shortly after he had assumed the chief executive role, the chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, was dismissed.\nOn November 13, following Donald Trump's election to the presidency, Bannon was appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the president-elect. His appointment drew opposition from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Council on American–Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republican strategists because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or antisemitic. However, a number of prominent Jews of the (politically) conservative persuasion defended Bannon against the allegations of anti-Semitism, including Ben Shapiro, David Horowitz, Pamela Geller, Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Morton Klein, the Zionist Organization of America, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.\nAlan Dershowitz at first defended Bannon, saying there was no evidence he was antisemitic, but then in a later piece stated that Bannon had made bigoted statements against Muslims, women, and others. The ADL stated \"We are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.\" Bannon had referred to French National Front (now National Rally) politician Marion Maréchal-Le Pen as \"the new rising star\".\nOn November 15, 2016, U.S. representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island released a letter to Trump signed by 169 Democratic House representatives urging the president-elect to rescind his appointment of Bannon. The letter stated that appointing Bannon \"sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be\", because his \"ties to the White Nationalist movement have been well documented\"; it went on to present several examples of Breitbart News's alleged xenophobia. Bannon denied being a white nationalist and said, rather, that he was an \"economic nationalist\".\nOn November 18, during his first interview not conducted by Breitbart Media since the 2016 presidential election, Bannon remarked on some criticisms made about him, saying, \"Darkness is good: Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\" The quote was published widely in the media.\nIn an interview with The New York Times in late November, Trump responded to the controversy over Bannon's appointment, saying, \"I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\"\nIn an interview with BBC Newsnight, Bannon said that his role was to \"recalibrate\" the campaign, which had at that point lost its message. He \"stepped in and got the campaign refocused\", but he rebuffed the idea that he was the reason Trump won the presidency, saying \"Trump is unique in American political history, he's his own closer.\" Bannon said his role was to make sure that Hillary Clinton was held up as a \"guardian of a corrupt and incompetent establishment\" and this that was key to winning votes in states that Trump needed to win.\nReuters reported on October 31, 2018, that the Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a \"wide-ranging\" investigation of Bannon's activities during the campaign, including knowledge he may have had about any contacts between Russia and two campaign advisors, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, as well as his role with Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n=== Trump administration ===\n\n\n==== Transition to the presidency ====\n\nIn 2018, Michael Lewis published a quote ascribed to Bannon, made while the transition team for Trump was supposed to be preparing for the next administration, and The Guardian used it twice in the title of an excerpt from the 2018 Lewis book The Fifth Risk. The book examined the difference between the transition preparations provided by the administration that was exiting and what did or did not occur, and it revealed a profound lack of preparedness and concern, as expressed in the quote.\n\n\n==== National Security Council ====\n\nAt the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the chief of staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues. The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E. Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser. In response, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the committee.\n\n\n==== Presidency of Donald Trump ====\nUpon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his chief strategist, a newly created position. The title made him a counselor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the chief of staff. As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation. Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as special assistant to President Trump.\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Bannon analogized his influence with Trump to that of \"Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors\".\nSeveral days after Trump's inauguration, on January 26, Bannon told The New York Times, \"The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. I want you to quote this: the media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\"\nBannon and Stephen Miller were involved in the creation of Executive Order 13769, which resulted in restricted U.S. travel and immigration by individuals from seven countries, suspension of the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, and indefinite suspension of the entry of Syrians to the United States. According to The Economist, a British news magazine, Bannon and Miller \"see Mr [Vladimir] Putin as a fellow nationalist and crusader against cosmopolitanism\".\n\nIn February 2017, Bannon appeared on the cover of Time, on which he was labeled \"the Great Manipulator\". The headline used for the associated article was \"Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?\", alluding to Bannon's perceived influence in the White House.\nIn a March 14, 2019, hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Commerce Department secretary Wilbur Ross was questioned about his conversations regarding the adding of a citizenship question to the 2020 census surveys, which he had with Bannon, who in turn had referred him to immigration hardliners Kris Kobach and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Missouri Democratic representative Lacy Clay accused Ross of being \"complicit\" regarding his efforts to weaken minority group voting rights, additionally accusing him of committing perjury with respect to those contacts. Clay called for Ross to tender his resignation, saying, \"You lied to Congress. You misled the American people and you are complicit in the Trump administration's intent to suppress the growing political power of the non-white population.\" Ross said the change was in response to a request by the Justice Department for statistics to protect voting rights. On April 23, 2019, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question.\nIt was reported that Bannon intentionally published stories to undermine H. R. McMaster. Bannon allegedly did this by leaking information to the alternative media, including alt-right writer Mike Cernovich. It was also reported that the Trump administration retroactively granted Bannon a blanket exemption from federal ethics rules that allowed him to communicate with editors at Breitbart News, which according to former Breitbart consultant Kurt Bardella would be proof of the administration's intent to allow him to continue being \"the de facto editorial director of Breitbart\" (italics added). In the final hours of Donald Trump's administration, Steve Bannon was issued a presidential pardon. The accompanying announcement said he was \"an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen\".\nBannon was removed from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a reorganization by U.S. national security advisor H. R. McMaster, whom Bannon had helped select. Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose in serving on the committee was as a check against former national security advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed. Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if President Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay. The White House said Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was \"total nonsense\". Bannon only attended one NSC meeting.\n\n\n==== Russia investigation ====\nBannon was interviewed multiple times by Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. Bannon was reportedly interviewed about Roger Stone's contact with WikiLeaks. In November 2019, Bannon gave evidence in the federal criminal trial of Roger Stone. Bannon did not voluntarily testify; rather, he was compelled to give evidence under subpoena. Bannon testified that Stone was WikiLeaks' access point for the Trump campaign; the testimony helped establish that Stone lied to Congress. Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges (lying to Congress and witness tampering), but on July 10, 2020, his federal prison sentence was commuted by President Trump. Asked for a comment after Bannon himself was arrested on August 20, 2020, Stone replied, \"Karma is a bitch. But I am praying for him.\"\nIn August 2020, members of the Senate intelligence committee told the Department of Justice (DOJ) that they believed that Bannon, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr. may have misled them with their testimony about Russia investigation.\n\n\n==== Quotes in Michael Wolff books ====\nIn January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies. The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\"; that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\"; and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr. to \"crack like an egg on live television\". Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank.\nIn his 2019 book Siege, Wolff wrote, \"Trump was vulnerable because for 40 years he had run what increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise,\" then quoted Bannon as saying, \"I think we can drop the 'semi' part.\" Wolff wrote that Bannon predicted investigations into Trump's finances would be his political downfall, quoting Bannon as saying, \"This is where it isn't a witch hunt – even for the hard core, this is where he turns into just a crooked business guy, and one worth $50 million instead of $10 billion. Not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag.\"\n\n\n=== Relationship with Donald Trump ===\nIn January 2018, after excerpts from Fire and Fury were published, Trump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements. Trump asserted in a tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job\" and publicly referred to Bannon with an unflattering nickname (\"Sloppy Steve\") in reference to Bannon's usually disheveled appearance. On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr. Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a detail which Wolff contested.\nDespite Trump's disparagement of him, Bannon retained ties with Trump. In an appearance in August 2019 on CNBC, Bannon praised Trump as a \"great leader as president\" and \"amazing campaigner\"; in response, Trump called Bannon \"one of my best pupils\" and \"still a giant Trump fan\" and said he \"loved working with\" Bannon. In 2018, Bannon released a pro-Trump documentary, Trump @War through his production company, Victory Films; the film aimed to galvanize Trump supporters ahead of the 2018 elections in a bid to keep a Republican majority in the House. In October 2019, Bannon began co-hosting War Room: Impeachment, a daily radio show and podcast in which he offered advice to the Trump administration and its allies on how to counter the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. In 2020, Bannon began a podcast War Room: Pandemic, broadcast from his Capitol Hill townhouse; Bannon told friends that Trump had \"told others that he watches the program and that the president was familiar enough with it to cite specific interviews he had seen when the two men spoke this summer\". A February 2023 Brookings Institution study found Bannon's podcast contained the highest proportion of false, misleading and unsubstantiated statements among 36,603 episodes produced by 79 prominent political podcasters.\n\n\n==== Departure from the White House ====\nBannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the August 11–12, 2017, Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony. Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'.\" The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon. The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today\", they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon – a well-known white supremacist leader – from his team of advisers\". The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House.\nSome sources stated that White House chief of staff John F. Kelly asked Bannon on August 18, 2017, to submit his immediate resignation in lieu of being fired. Bannon, however, stated he was not fired but rather submitted his two-week resignation notice on August 4, 2017. He reminded The Weekly Standard that he had joined then-presidential candidate Trump's campaign on August 14, 2016, and said he'd \"always planned on spending one year\", but that he stayed a few more days due to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nIn an official statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \"John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\"\nThe same day, Breitbart News announced that Bannon would return to the site as executive chairman. Several weeks after his departure it was reported that Trump still called Bannon using his personal cell phone and was only calling when chief of staff Kelly was not around. The Washington Post reported in October 2017 that Trump and Bannon remained in regular contact.\n\n\n=== Republican Senate primaries ===\nBannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda. In October 2017, Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections. He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader and to end the Senate filibuster. Bannon used his group Citizens of the American Republic to aide him in his efforts to help keep Republican control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 election. The group is a dark money organization; Bannon declined to \"describe his donors or how much money the group has raised\".\nBannon received credit for helping Roy Moore defeat incumbent senator Luther Strange in the September Republican primary for the 2017 special Alabama Senate election, despite Trump's having endorsed Strange. After nine women alleged sexual misconduct, Bannon doubled down on his support for the candidate, raising doubt about the veracity of the accusations. When Ivanka Trump condemned Moore's campaign in Alabama, saying \"there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children\", Bannon responded, \"What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\", in reference to a woman who accused Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of raping her at that age.\nIn what had been considered a safe Republican seat, Moore lost the election on December 12, 2017. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was subsequently questioned by Republican commentators.\n\n\n== Post-White House career ==\n\n\n=== Work abroad ===\nAfter leaving the White House in August 2017, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement\". He toured Europe to speak at events with various far-right political parties there, in a bid to build a network of right-wing populist-nationalist parties aspiring to government. Bannon visited the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Freedom Party of Austria in October 2017, the UK Conservative Party in December 2017, the Swiss People's Party in March 2018, the UK Independence Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Belgian People's Party, Alternative for Germany in March 2018, France's National Front (now the National Rally) in March 2018, the Italian League, the Brothers of Italy in September 2018, Hungary's Fidesz in March 2018, the Sweden Democrats in March 2018, the Polish Law and Justice in September 2018, Spain's Vox in July 2018, the Finns Party in July 2018, the pan-European identitarian movement in March 2018, Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats in August 2018, the Five Star Movement in May 2019, and the Israeli Likud. Bannon believes that these movements – along with Japan's Shinzo Abe, India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman, China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Trump, as well as similar leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Poland, and South Korea – are part of a global shift towards nationalism. Bannon's attempt to build a network of far-right parties in Europe had only limited success; while he appeared at events with the French National Rally's Marine Le Pen and the Italian League's Matteo Salvini, the Sweden Democrats said that it had \"no interest\" in Bannon's initiative, the Flemish Vlaams Belang called it \"poorly organized\", and the Alternative for Germany cited divergent views among the parties. Right-wing populist parties did not achieve a surge in support in the 2019 European Parliament elections. The Atlantic cited a number of factors inhibiting Bannon's project, including differing national and ideological views among the European far right and U.S.-skeptical views held by some parties of the European extreme right.\nBannon supports the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a right-wing Catholic organization in Italy formerly based in what was previously Trisulti Charterhouse; Bannon drafted a leadership course curriculum for the group to train conservative Catholic political activists. In 2018, Bannon announced that he planned to establish a right-wing academy on the site, with the support of Benjamin Harnwell, a British associate of Bannon's who underwrote the project and aimed to create a \"gladiator school for culture warriors\". However, in 2019, the group's rights to use the former monastery were revoked by the Italian government because it determined that the lessee Dignitatis Humanae Institute failed to meet several criteria to operate the monastery and failed in its obligation to pay a \"concession fee\" as well as maintenance and security expenses.\nIn August 2018, Bannon met with Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, and served as informal advisor to the Bolsonaro campaign in the Brazilian presidential elections that year. In February 2019, the younger Bolsonaro joined Bannon's organization the Movement as its representative in South America. In March 2019, Bannon met with both Bolsonaros in Washington, D.C.\nIn October 2017, after leaving the White House, Bannon met exiled Chinese billionaire businessman Guo Wengui (also known as Miles Kwok), and the pair cultivated a friendship, frequently meeting in Dallas, at Guo's apartment at the Sherry-Netherland in New York, and on Guo's yacht. In 2017, Guo reportedly gave a $150,000 loan to Bannon shortly after he left the White House, and a Guo-linked company entered into a $1 million consulting contract with Bannon, beginning in August 2018. In early 2020, Bannon and Guo raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a private offering for a company called GTV Media Group. In August 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the fundraising for the company was under investigation of federal and state authorities.\nGuo has allowed Bannon to use one of his two private jets, and during the 2018 election campaign, Bannon flew on Guo's Bombardier Global Express to events in support of Republican congressional candidates in New Mexico and Arizona. The flights were revealed in February 2020 by ProPublica. Bannon made the flights under the auspices of his dark money group, Citizens of the American Republic. Several campaign finance experts who spoke with ProPublica said the trips could violate federal campaign finance law, which prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to candidates in U.S. political campaigns (including in-kind contributions such as payment for campaign-related travel). Guo and Bannon denied that the travel was for campaign activity; an attorney for Bannon's group stated that the trips on the private jet were to promote Bannon's film, Trump@War.\nOn June 3, 2020, Bannon and Guo participated in declaring a \"New Federal State of China\" (also called \"Federal State of New China\"). It was said that they would overthrow the Chinese government. In New York City, planes were seen carrying banners which said, \"Congratulations to Federal State of New China!\".\nOn August 20, 2020, federal prosecutors in New York unsealed criminal charges against Stephen K. Bannon and three other men they alleged defrauded donors to a massive crowdfunding campaign that said it was raising money for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. After Bannon's arrest, Guo Wengui hurriedly cut ties with him, stressed that he was not involved in Bannon's affairs outside their shared efforts \"fighting for democracy in China\", and would no longer allow Bannon to continue to serve as a member of Guo Media's board of directors.\nIn November 2020, The New York Times reported that Bannon along with Guo Wengui had been promoting Li-Meng Yan's account of COVID-19. The pair had bought Yan a plane ticket to the United States, provided her accommodation, coached her in media appearances and helped secure interviews with conservative television hosts including Tucker Carlson. Yan later said that the COVID-19 virus was artificially made, however her interview was rejected on social media as misinformation and her research rejected by scientists who said it was \"based on conjecture\" though filled with jargon.\n\n\n=== Treatment of colleagues ===\nIn an interview with Frontline, former writer for Breitbart News Ben Shapiro said that he tried to avoid interacting with Bannon due to a fear of being on his bad side. Shapiro also recalled Bannon yelling and cursing at people at Breitbart News. Those who worked with Bannon have described him as \"egomaniacal\" and \"purely Machiavellian\". Other former staffers at Breitbart who spoke to Politico said that Bannon would degrade employees by mocking their intelligence and would imply they were \"expendable, low-life creatures\". Several employees who left Breitbart alleged that when they attempted to find employment outside of Breitbart, Bannon attempted to sabotage them. However, other employees praised Bannon's leadership describing him as a generous, loyal, caring, and supportive. Many described Bannon as someone who would pay out of his own pocket for personal expenses.\nIn his memoir, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner recalled having an abrasive relationship with Bannon and two occasions in which Bannon threatened him, including one in which he threatened to 'break Kushner in half' after he accused Bannon of leaking to the press. Also in his memoir Kushner writes \"Bannon single-handedly caused more problems for me than anyone else in my time in Washington. He probably leaked and lied about me more than everyone else combined. He played dirty and dragged me into the mud of the Russia investigation\".\nHe only paid part of the $850,000 legal bill charged by Davidoff, Hutcher & Citron LLP, who represented him in the case for contempt of Congress for his defiance of the January 6 committee subpoena and in the case for the \"We Build the Wall\" fraud scheme. The law firm sued Bannon, and in July 2023, he was ordered to pay the remaining balance.\n\n\n=== Connection to Jeffrey Epstein ===\nAccording to Michael Wolff, Bannon was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein in 2017 and Epstein introduced Bannon to some of his friends. Bannon also worked with Ehud Barak and attorney Reid Weingarten to attempt to reform Epstein's public image. Later reports showed Bannon reportedly prepped Epstein for an interview with 60 Minutes that ultimately never occurred. Bannon confirmed that he did tape 15 hours of interviews with Epstein but denied that he was coaching him for further interviews and that the footage was for an unannounced documentary on Epstein.\n\n\n=== Criminal prosecutions ===\n\n\n==== Dismissed 1996 domestic violence charges ====\nBannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after his then-wife, Mary Piccard, accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The Santa Monica Police Department crime report states that after Piccard called 911, an officer arrived at their home and observed red marks on Piccard's wrist and neck. The charges were later dropped when Piccard did not appear in court. In her divorce filing, Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made against her by Bannon and his lawyer: Bannon, she said, told her, \"if I went to court, he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty.\" She said that Bannon's lawyer also threatened her, telling her that if Mr. Bannon went to jail, she \"would have no money and no way to support the children\". Bannon's lawyer denied pressuring Piccard not to testify.\n\n\n==== Charges related to We Build the Wall campaign ====\n\n\n===== 2020 federal fraud and money laundering indictment =====\nOn August 20, 2020, a federal grand jury indictment was unsealed against Bannon and three others, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison upon conviction. Federal prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege that Bannon, United States Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage and the two other defendants used funds received from the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign, marketed to support the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, in a way which was \"inconsistent\" with how they were advertised for use to the public. According to the indictment, donations were collected through a GoFundMe campaign that was launched in December 2018. Bannon promoted the project until the day before the indictment, saying \"You've been the leader of this, assisting President Trump in building this wall in these tough areas\" in his War Room: Pandemic podcast.\nFederal prosecutors allege that Bannon and the three other men conspired to use a non-profit group run by Bannon, and a shell company controlled by one of the other defendants, to make payments to themselves, despite promises to donors that their contributions would go to build a wall. Prosecutors also alleged that Bannon received more than $1 million in connection with the plan, some of which was paid to Kolfage in secret and some of which Bannon and two other defendants allegedly used for personal expenses ranging from paying off credit cards to personal travel. Prosecutors stated that they plan to seize the assets of Bannon's non-profit Citizens of the American Republic, as well as other organizations \"politically aligned with [Donald] Trump\".\nBannon was arrested by U.S. postal inspectors on Long Island Sound, off the coast of Connecticut, on board People's Republic of China expatriate Guo Wengui's luxury yacht. Later that day, Bannon pleaded not guilty to the charges. Bannon was released pending trial on a $5 million bond, of which Bannon was required to put up $1.7 million. He was required to surrender his passport and his domestic travel was restricted. Following the indictment, Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr. distanced themselves from Bannon. Trump Jr. had originally been supportive of Bannon's fundraising efforts for the Trump wall.\nAt a preliminary hearing on August 31, U.S. district judge Analisa Torres set a trial date for May 24, 2021. Prosecutors revealed that they had collected a large number of emails found on various devices and online storage accounts after search warrants were executed—some earlier in the year.\n\n\n====== Pardon by Trump ======\n\nShortly before midnight on Tuesday, January 19, the final full day of Trump's presidency, Trump issued a series of pardons to 144 individuals, including Bannon. The White House released the list of pardoned individuals at 12:50am on January 20, Trump's final day in office.\nIn May 2021, Judge Torres, following the precedent of criminal cases being dismissed following presidential pardons, dismissed the fraud case against Bannon. Torres said that because the pardon was valid, dismissal of the indictment was \"the proper course\". In her ruling, Torres stated that despite Bannon not pleading guilty, \"the issuance of a pardon may carry an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.\" She further quoted: \"If there be no guilt, there is no ground for forgiveness.\"\n\n\n===== 2022 New York state indictment =====\nFederal pardons only cover federal offenses, so Trump's pardon of Bannon did not preclude state charges against him. By February 2021, the Manhattan district attorney had issued subpoenas to Wells Fargo Bank and GoFundMe, which had provided accounts for the venture. In August 2022, Bannon was indicted on New York state charges of money laundering, conspiracy and fraud related to the $25 million \"We Build the Wall\" scheme. Bannon claimed the charges were politically motivated, and—invoking a common right-wing conspiracy theory—somehow linked the charges to financier George Soros. Bannon said that he and Trump would not \"stop fighting\" and \"they will have to kill me first\". \nHe surrendered to authorities on September 8, 2022. The trial was originally expected to start May 27, 2024, however it was postponed to September 23, 2024 because the judge in that case, Juan Merchan, was also overseeing the Trump \"hush-money\" case and was unavailable at that time. Due to an ongoing conflict, Bannon's case was reassigned to Judge April Newbauer who later rescheduled it for December 9, 2024.\n\n\n==== 2022 contempt of Congress conviction and prison stay ====\nOn September 23, 2021, the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack subpoenaed Bannon, ordering him to appear on October 14. His lawyers gave the committee advance notice that he would not comply. After he did not appear, the House of Representatives voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress and to refer him to the Justice Department. This was initiated by the nine-member committee's unanimous vote on October 19, followed by the full House of Representatives which voted 229–202, with all 220 Democrats and 9 Republicans in favor of the resolution, on October 21. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on November 12, 2021, on two criminal contempt charges: one count of not providing documents, and one count of not testifying. Three days later, Bannon surrendered to the FBI. He was represented by criminal defense attorney David Schoen. He pleaded not guilty.\nBannon was released pending trial, without bail, but on conditions, including keeping authorities informed of his whereabouts, and not leaving the country.  An appeals court in April 2022 rejected his appeal regarding his failure to testify before the committee.\nIn the days leading up to his trial, Bannon offered to testify before the January 6 committee after all; U.S. district judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, rejected Bannon's offer as a \"last-ditch attempt to avoid accountability.\" Bannon sought to delay his trial to October, citing negative publicity from the concurrent televised committee hearings; the court denied the motions. Bannon incorrectly asserted Trump had claimed executive privilege over his testimony and documents, and said he would call prominent Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi to testify at his trial, asserting on his podcast, \"we're going medieval on these people.\" Nichols denied the defense motions, finding that Bannon was not entitled to raise an \"advice of counsel\" defense or an executive privilege defense. After the judge's ruling, Bannon's attorney Schoen asked the court, \"what's the point of going to trial if there are no defenses?\", to which Nichols replied, \"agreed\", hinting that Bannon should seek a plea deal.\nThe trial began on July 18, 2022, with the jury being finalized the next day. Bannon declined to call witnesses or testify in his own defense.\nOn July 22, 2022, the jury found Bannon guilty on both charges. Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the January 6 Committee, called Bannon's conviction \"a victory for the rule of law and an important affirmation of the Select Committee's work\". The DOJ prosecutor said that Bannon \"chose allegiance to Donald Trump over compliance with the law\" and \"No one is above the law\"; prosecutors also said that Bannon had \"thumbed his nose\" at American democracy and law.\nOn October 21, 2022, Judge Nichols sentenced Bannon to serve four months in prison and pay a $6,500 fine. Nichols stated in issuing the sentence, \"Others must be deterred from committing similar crimes.\" The DOJ had requested the maximum penalty (six months in jail), plus a $200,000 fine.\nOn November 4, 2022, Bannon appealed his conviction and sentence; he remained free pending appeal, with his sentence put on hold. In January 2023, his lawyers argued that the DOJ had improperly searched his private communications. Due to the unexpected death of a government lawyer's son, Bannon's appeal hearing was delayed from October 12 to November 9 at the request of the DOJ. Bannon did not attend the hearing; his attorney David Schoen did. On May 10, 2024, the appellate court unanimously upheld the conviction and on May 14, the DOJ filed a motion to lift Bannon's stay of sentence and have him report to prison.\n\nOn June 6, 2024, Judge Carl Nichols granted the motion and ordered Bannon to report to prison by July 1 unless the full appeals court were to take the case and pause enforcement of the sentence. Because of the pending case against him in New York, he was not eligible for a minimum-security prison, and it was decided that he would instead go to Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, a low-security prison in Connecticut. On June 26, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that House Republicans would intercede on behalf of Bannon with the federal court considering his appeal, though they did not file any briefs doing so. \nOn June 21, Bannon made an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied it in a one-sentence order on June 28. He reported to the low-level security Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury in Danbury, Connecticut on July 1, 2024, where he lives in a special veterans housing unit according to his federal prison consultant Sam Mangel. He is the second Trump era official to be jailed for contempt related to defying a subpoena from the January 6 Committee, after Peter Navarro.\n\n\n== Social media bans ==\nDuring the November 5, 2020, edition of his webcast, Bannon called for the beheadings of Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious diseases expert, and FBI director Christopher Wray. Bannon said that if it were up to him, after beheading Fauci and Wray, \"I'd put the heads on pikes\" and display them outside the White House \"as a warning to bureaucrats\" who dared oppose Trump. By the end of the day, Facebook and YouTube had deleted the video from their platforms, and Twitter had permanently banned his account for glorifying violence. Mailchimp also disabled Bannon's email newsletter. The next day, Bannon was dropped by a lawyer who had been defending him against federal charges of fraud.\nOn January 9, 2021, Rudy Giuliani appeared on War Room, accusing Democrats of stealing the recent presidential election and blaming them for the storming of the Capitol. Hours later, YouTube removed both the podcast channel and another one called \"Trump at War – A Film by Stephen K. Bannon\", citing a \"violation of YouTube's Terms of Service\".\n\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\nBannon is a Reaganite and has described himself as a populist.\nLebanese-American author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin and conservative intellectual Michael Anton have been pointed out as three of the main influences in Steve Bannon's political thinking. Political theorist and philosopher Edmund Burke has also been described as a major influence on Bannon's ideological outlook. According to The Guardian in January 2018, Bannon's ideology is similar to that of Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson, Benny Johnson, Raheem Kassam and Matthew Boyle, the latter two having been protégés of Bannon at Breitbart.\nDespite being arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering in connection with the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign in August 2020, in an interview, Bannon told journalist Michael Lewis in February 2018, \"We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall. This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\" He added, \"The Democrats don't matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\"\n\n\n=== Individual issues ===\nA self-described economic nationalist, Bannon advocates for reductions in immigration and restrictions on free trade with China and Mexico. He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. He has been described as a white nationalist but rejects the description. He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\".\n\n\n==== Paris climate agreement ====\nBannon was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement. During his time in the Trump administration, he successfully persuaded Donald Trump to withdraw from it.\n\n\n==== Immigration ====\nBannon favors reducing immigration, both legal and illegal immigration, to the U.S. and asserts that immigration threatens national sovereignty. Bannon has suggested that too many Silicon Valley chief executives are Asian or South Asian, and that this undermines \"civic society\". In a 2015 radio appearance, Bannon expressed opposition to resettling any refugees of the Syrian Civil War in the U.S. In a 2016 radio appearance, Bannon asserted that illegal immigration was \"horrific\" but that legal immigration was \"the beating heart of this problem\"; that levels of legal immigration to the U.S. were \"scary\"; and that legal immigrants had \"kinda overwhelmed the country\".\nBannon was the chairman of We Build the Wall, an organization involved in the construction of the proposed expansion of Mexico–United States barrier.\n\n\n==== Economics ====\nBannon often describes himself as an economic nationalist, criticizing crony capitalism, Austrian economics, and the objectivist capitalism of Ayn Rand. He also generally considers himself a free-market capitalist. Bannon favors raising federal income taxes to 44 percent for those earning incomes over $5 million a year as a way to pay for middle class tax cuts. He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as \"the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan\".\nIn 2014, during a conference at the Vatican, Bannon criticized Wall Street for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. He has also criticized bail outs for big banks and is angered by the fact that Wall Street banks have not been held accountable for the financial crisis, which he says fueled populist fury and groups such as the Tea Party.\n\n\n==== Gun control ====\nAmid ongoing national debates on gun violence and gun control, Bannon has been vocal in advocating for broader access to firearms, emphasizing the importance of the Second Amendment. He has been vocal in warning Trump against any shifts towards gun control, emphasizing the potential for intense backlash from the president's base. A notable instance of this was his reaction to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, where Bannon insisted that any move by Trump towards gun control would be the \"end of everything,\" suggesting that it would be received even more negatively than an immigration amnesty bill by Trump's political base. Expanding on his pro-gun stance, Bannon sparked controversy by advocating for the arming and training of children in the use of firearms. Speaking at Turning Point USA's America Fest in December 2023, he proposed that gun classes should be integrated into school curriculums as a means for children to defend themselves against bullies.\n\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nHe is generally skeptical of military intervention abroad, opposing proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in the War in Afghanistan, the Syrian Civil War, and the crisis in Venezuela.\nIn Afghanistan, he supported a proposal by Erik Prince for the deployment of private military contractors instead of the U.S. military. He believes \"there is no military solution\" to the 2017 North Korea crisis.\nBannon has described U.S. allies in Europe, the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca, as well as South Korea and Japan, as having become \"protectorates of the United States\" that do not \"make an effort to defend [themselves]\", and believes NATO members should pay a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense.\nBannon opposes upgrading the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Bannon strongly favors U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and was supportive of the approach taken by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis.\nDuring his tenure as White House chief strategist, Bannon opposed the 2017 Shayrat missile strike, but lost the internal debate on the matter to Kushner. He also expressed skepticism about the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani, questioning whether it was \"necessary to kill this guy and to kill him now and to exacerbate the military issues\", and warned that an escalation with Iran could undermine Trump's support with \"working-class, middle-class people, particularly people whose sons and daughters actually fight in these wars\".\nHe has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. Bannon reportedly spoke often with Trump donor Sheldon Adelson, and was alarmed at a push for a renewed Middle East peace process. He has described Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a \"terrorist\". He has advocated giving the land in the West Bank to Jordan and in Gaza to Egypt.\n\n\n==== China ====\nBannon believes the U.S. is not merely in a Cold War but already in a \"hot war\" with China, especially in the domains of information and economics. Bannon expressed concerns about China's growing influence in Asia, viewing the nation as expansionist and anticipating a global culture clash. He holds the view that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) must be confronted and suggests that the ongoing informational and economic confrontations will escalate into a \"kinetic war\". Bannon believes a military confrontation between the US and China in the South China Sea will occur within the next decade. He highlighted China's construction of artificial islands, equating them to stationary aircraft carriers with missiles, as a primary concern.\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nAlthough \"those who met him say\" Bannon initially favored the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL) in the United Kingdom, he later backed the UK Independence Party (UKIP).\nBannon urged Boris Johnson, who Bannon said in July 2018 that he had known \"over the last year\" and was \"very impressed\" with, to challenge Prime Minister Theresa May. According to a BuzzFeed News report, Bannon was in private contact with Johnson during his visit to Britain that month, and the two men were previously in text communication during their respective tenures as White House chief strategist and British foreign secretary.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\n\nBannon has defended Trump's ties to and praise for Russian president Vladimir Putin. He expressed a belief that traditionalists see Russia as an ally. Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism—and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country. They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\". According to the book War for Eternity, Bannon met notorious Russian ideologue Aleksandr Dugin in Rome in 2018 to advocate closer relations between the United States and Russia, as well as Traditionalist philosophy.\nIn 2018, Bannon announced plans to launch a new political operation beginning with an attempt to unite populist parties across Europe before the 2019 European Parliament election. With the project to be based in Brussels, he indicated he would spend 50 percent of his time in Europe from the following November working at locations throughout the continent. Later that year, Bannon formed a foundation called The Movement to connect far-right groups throughout Europe.\nBannon is supportive of European right-wing populist national conservative movements such as the Hungarian Fidesz, the French National Front (now National Rally), the Spanish Vox, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany, the Italian Northern League, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People's Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance, the Polish Law and Justice, and the Swiss People's Party.\n\n\n==== Islam ====\nIn 2007, Bannon proposed and developed a script for a documentary titled Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Fascism in America. The film's plot was that there was an effort by Muslims to take over America.\nIn 2010, Bannon said \"Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of submission\". He also criticized George W. Bush for calling Islam a religion of peace. Bannon has said that Islam today is \"something much darker\" than Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. He has also stated, \"If you're Sharia-compliant ... we don't want you here,\" and has accused U.S. newspapers of being \"Sharia-compliant\". He has also stated, \"The elites in Europe ... are allowing an Islamic invasion to take place.\" and that the war with Islamic fascism is \"metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.\"\nIn his talk delivered to a small conference in the Vatican during 2014, Bannon said: \"If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places...it bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West\". He is reputed to believe Putin's Russia and Trump's America are Christian allies against the Islamic State and \"radical Islamic terrorism\". During Bannon's time in the Trump administration Bannon and Stephen Miller helped orchestrate Executive Order 13769 which banned entrance into United States from seven majority Muslim countries. Bannon has been linked to the counter-jihad movement.\n\n\n==== Transhumanism and new technologies ====\nBannon sees transhumanism as a dangerous and radical religion of \"the technocratic elite\". He accuses tech entrepreneurs of using \"transhumanistic science\" to control humanity and eradicate religion through advanced gene editing, robotics, and forced microscopic implants. He has accused transhumanists of wanting eternal life at the expense of disregarding people's religious beliefs. Bannon's recent preoccupation with transhumanism aligns with his anti-vaccine rhetoric, and he has adopted similar positions as Alex Jones on this topic. In discussions with his frequent podcast contributor Joe Allen, he also promotes viewpoints against AI and other new technologies inspired by \"The Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski. On his podcast, Bannon said he was proud to be a Luddite and expressed concern that Homo sapiens could be replaced in the near future.\n\n\n=== Overview and influences ===\nBannon's ideology was the subject of the book War for Eternity by Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, where his thinking is described as combining elements of a radical version of the Traditionalist school with paleoconservatism and other more standard American conservative beliefs. Bannon's political and economic views have been described by others as nationalist, and right-wing populist. He self-identifies as a conservative. He rejects allegations that he is a white nationalist.\nAt a party congress in March 2018, Bannon gave members of the French right-wing populist National Front (NF) what has been described as a \"populist pep talk\". He advised party members to \"Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker...History is on our side and will bring us victory.\" Bannon's remarks brought the members to their feet. Critics expressed concern that Bannon was \"normalizing racism\".\nBannon was influenced by Fourth Turning theory, outlined in Neil Howe's and William Strauss's The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy, one of Bannon's favorite books. The theory proposes, \"populism, nationalism and state-run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. [...Once one strips] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with only a limited number of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order\" and cyclically. The book was major influence on Bannon's film Generation Zero.\nBannon's political beliefs have been influenced by René Guénon's traditionalism, a form of anti-modernist thought that views \"certain ancient religions, including the Hindu Vedanta, Sufism, and medieval Catholicism\" as being repositories of spiritual truth under attack by Western secularism; he synthesizes traditionalist beliefs with Catholic social doctrine, particularly the idea of subsidiarity, as expressed in the 1931 papal encyclical, Quadragesimo anno, defending that political matters ought to be handled by the lowest, least centralized competent authority. According to Bannon's former friends, he was particularly influenced by the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita and the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War. Bannon has also cited the Russian neo-fascist Alexander Dugin, who promotes a Russian nationalist variant of traditionalism called Eurasianism, and described himself as a fan of Dugin's book, The Fourth Political Theory. However, Bannon has urged Dugin to abandon his anti-American and Sinophile views. Bannon has also described Brazilian traditionalist thinker Olavo de Carvalho as \"one of the great conservative intellectuals in the world\".\nBannon is an admirer of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Bannon's favorite columnist is academic Walter Russell Mead. In a 2014 speech to a Vatican conference, Bannon made a passing reference to Julius Evola, a twentieth-century, Nazi-linked Italian writer who influenced Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism and promoted the Traditionalist School, described by a New York Times writer as \"a worldview popular in far-right and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions.\" Bannon's interest in the ideas of the Traditionalist School was driven by Evola's book Revolt Against the Modern World, and Guénon's books Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta and The Crisis of the Modern World. In March 2016, Bannon stated he appreciates \"any piece that mentions Evola\". In referring to the associated views of Vladimir Putin, who is influenced by Evola follower Dugin, Bannon stated \"We, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he's talking about as far as Traditionalism goes — particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism.\" He has likewise quoted French anti-Enlightenment writer Charles Maurras approvingly to a French diplomat. Bannon has also repeatedly referenced the controversial French novel The Camp of the Saints (1973) by Jean Raspail, which depicts Third World immigration destroying Western civilization. He has embraced what BBC News describes as Savitri Devi's \"account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil\". Bannon told an interviewer in 2018 that he is \"fascinated by Mussolini\", noting: \"He was clearly loved by women. He was a guy's guy. He has all that virility. He also had amazing fashion sense, right, that whole thing with the uniforms.\" A former Breitbart writer wrote that Bannon said in 2015 that alt-right publication American Renaissance was \"fighting the same fight\" as him. Bannon has expressed admiration for German Conservative Revolutionary philosopher Martin Heidegger, praising his \"ideas on the subject of being\".\nGerman film director Leni Riefenstahl, who produced propaganda films for the regime in Nazi Germany, is said to have influenced Bannon's film-making techniques, with Bannon once describing himself to writing colleague Julia Jones as the \"Riefenstahl of George Bush\", modifying the ending as \"the GOP\" when Jones was horrified. The opening of Bannon's documentary film The Hope & The Change (2012) consciously imitated Riefenstahl's film The Triumph of the Will (1935), which depicted the Nuremberg Rally held in 1934.\nHe has expressed interest in Henri Bergson's concept of élan vital and Joseph Schumpeter's creative destruction. Additionally, he said that his initial inspiration to get into traditionalist philosophy was his reading of George Gurdjieff, when Dugin asked him to explain this during a meeting they had together in Rome.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nBannon has been married and divorced three times. He has three adult daughters. His first marriage was to Cathleen Suzanne Houff. Bannon and Houff had a daughter, Maureen, in 1988 and subsequently divorced.\nBannon's second marriage was to Mary Louise Piccard, a former investment banker, in April 1995. Their twin daughters were born three days after the wedding. Piccard filed for dissolution of their marriage in 1997.\nDuring their divorce proceedings, Piccard alleged that Bannon had made antisemitic remarks about her choice of schools, saying he did not want to send his children to The Archer School for Girls because there were too many Jews at the school, and Jews raise their children to be \"whiny brats\". Bannon's spokesperson denied the accusation, noting that he had chosen to send both his children to the Archer School.\nBannon's third marriage was to model Diane Clohesy; they married in 2006 and divorced in 2009.\nHis brother, Chris Bannon, is a TV producer.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nBannon has been a producer, writer, director or actor on the following films and documentaries:\n\n\n== See also ==\nMueller Report\nRussian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum\nTimeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\nRussian interference in the 2016 United States elections\nUnhumans\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSteve Bannon at IMDb\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nFederal fraud and money laundering indictment"

He has approached this general topic by investigating how information and redundancy are fundamental for controlling the behavior and evolutionary capabilities of complex systems, as well as abstracting principles from natural systems to produce adaptive information technology.\nAccepting Von Neumann's principle of self-replication and Turing's universal computation as a general principle for generating open-ended complexity that encompasses Natural Selection, Dr. Rocha has developed the work of Howard Pattee, Sydney Brenner, and others who regard computation and information as fundamental to understanding life, cognition and other complex systems (a good overview is Gleick's Book). From this viewpoint, he has approached several questions: how do cells and collectives of cells compute? Is language an evolutionary system operating under the same principle? Can artificial systems implement the same principle? Namely, can collective intelligence on the web become a super-organism implementing this principle?  From these questions, he has worked on various specific research projects ranging from Biomedical Literature Mining and Social Media Mining to understanding redundancy, robustness, modularity and control in Complex Networks,  Collective Intelligence on the Web and in Social Systems, and..."

        "context": "Dafydd Gibbon (born 5 April 1944) is a British emeritus professor of English and General Linguistics at Bielefeld University in Germany, specialising in computational linguistics,\nthe lexicography of spoken languages,\napplied phonetics and phonology. He is particularly concerned with endangered languages and has received awards from the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Poland.\nGibbon is the author of over 180 publications, editor of three handbooks and three further collections, and supervisor of 21 PhD theses. He has been Visiting Professor at Jinan University (JNU), Guangzhou, China, \nsince 2016.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDafydd Gibbon was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, UK.\nHe is the son of a Welsh Baptist clergyman, John Thomas Gibbon (1915–1973) and Mary Gibbon (née Hudson, a physical education teacher, 1918–2012), with whom he and his four siblings lived in different towns in England and Wales during their father's pastoral ministry. \nHe attended elementary school and grammar school in Huddersfield and grammar schools in Llanelli, South Wales, and in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. \nHis grandparents were tenant farmers in Pembrokeshire, South Wales, and they and his father were native speakers of Welsh. As a child he experienced inter-generational language loss, being spoken to only in English, but retaining basic knowledge of Welsh thanks to Welsh lessons in school.\nGibbon studied German, French and theology at King's College, University of London. \nHe earned his B.A. Honours from the University of London and his Associate of King's College in 1966. He received his doctor of philosophy degree at the University of Göttingen in 1976, with a dissertation on Perspectives of intonation analysis (1976).\nIts discussion of \"calling\" or \"vocative invocation\" was considered \"the most complete discussion of the subject to date\".\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nGibbon started his academic career in the year 1968 as an English lecturer at the Seminar für Englische Philologie, University of Göttingen, Germany. Four years later he became an assistant professor at that university and held this position until 1980. In 1980–1981 he worked as professor for Theory and Practice of translation at University of Applied Sciences in Cologne. In 1981 he became professor of English and General Linguistics at the Faculty of Linguistics and Literary Studies at Bielefeld University in Germany, working there until his retirement in 2009.\nGibbon participated in the European Speech Assessment Methods (SAM) project and was involved in development of the SAMPA Alphabet in this project, and in the European EAGLES projects. As part of these projects he was lead editor of two handbooks on standards and evaluation of speech technology systems (1997, 2000).\nIn the international Verbmobil project for speech-to-speech translation, he was the lexicographic coordinator for the development of an inheritance lexicon, supporting speaker independent automatic translation from German to English and Japanese.\nHe became Convenor of the international COCOSDA group (International Coordinating Committee for Speech Databases and Assessment) from 2006 until 2014.\nHe has published mainly in the areas of computational phonology, prosody, and lexicography. He has researched English, German, Welsh, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Yacouba, and Baule (Ivory Coast), Tem (Togo), \nIgbo, \nand Ibibio (Nigeria), Kuki-Thadou (India) and Mandarin (China), and is particularly concerned about endangered languages.\nOn 10 March 2010, Gibbon was selected as Linguist of the Day on the Linguist List and then again on 27 March 2018 as Featured Linguist.\nHis Erdős number is 4, with the lineage Erdős – Tarski – Maddux – Ladkin – Gibbon, and his current h-index is 27.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nGibbon has received various awards including the following:\n\n1968: University of London Laurel for ecumenical work on the Religious Affairs Sub-Committee as President of the John Clifford Society (London Baptist Students Society)\n1992: Best Paper Award, KONVENS 1992, Nürnberg: \"Prosody, time types and linguistic design factors in spoken language system architectures.\" (1992)\n1994: Best Paper Award, DAGM Symposium, Wien: \"Detektion unbekannter Wörter mit Hilfe phonotaktischer Modelle\", co-awarded with A.

        "answer": "Free University of Berlin",
        "context": "Dieter Jungnickel (born 20 March 1952 in Berlin) is a German mathematician specializing in combinatorics.\nIn 1971 Jungnickel entered the Free University of Berlin, graduating in 1975. He studied the finite difference method with Hanfried Lenz and completed his Habilitation in 1978. He became a professor of mathematics at University of Giessen in 1980.\nThe uses of finite geometry in coding theory led Jungnickel and Thomas Beth to write \"Variations of Seven Points\" which used the Fano plane as a starting point.\nWith Thomas Beth and Hanfried Lenz he wrote Design Theory (1985) on combinatorial design. Albrecht Beutelspacher reviewed it positively as deserving high estimation, and as an impressive work. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 1986. He updated the work in 1989 For the second edition Design Theory (1999) was split into two volumes, one and two.\nIn 1990 Jungnickel wrote an article on geometric and graph-theoretical aspects of latin squares of interest in coding theory. In September 1990 University of Vermont was the site of a conference concerned with the mathematics of coding theory, and commemorating the contributions of Marshall Hall. Together with Scott Vanstone, Jungnickel edited the Proceedings. \nIn 1993 Jungnickel joined Augsburg University where he occupies the chair for discrete mathematics, optimisation, and operations research.\nJungnickel wrote about finite fields in 1993: Finite fields, Structure and Arithmetics. A reviewer notes that \"The author does a beautiful job showing and developing the practical applicability of the fascinating area of finite field theory\".\nIn 1999 his book Graphs, Networks and Algorithms appeared as translation of the 1994 German version. A reviewer calls it a \"first class textbook\" and indispensable for teachers of combinatorial optimization. The second edition appeared in 2005, the third in 2008, and the fourth in 2013.\n\n\n== References =="

        "context": "Eduardo Reck Miranda (born 1963) is a Brazilian composer of chamber and electroacoustic pieces but is most notable in the United Kingdom for his scientific research into computer music, particularly in the field of human-machine interfaces where brain waves will replace keyboards and voice commands to permit the disabled to express themselves musically.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nMiranda was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil. As one of the largest cities in Southern Brazil and a cultural, political and economical center, Porto Alegre had significant influence on Miranda's music.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nIn the early 1990s, Miranda attended the University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS) in Brazil where he received a degree in Data Processing Technology in 1985. Miranda then attended the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) where he studied music composition. Desiring to learn more about music technology and experience more of the world, Miranda made his way to the United Kingdom, where he started his post-graduate research studies at the University of York. At York, he developed an in-depth study into musical composition using cellular automata. In 1991, he received his MSc in Music Technology from York. After receiving his MSc, Miranda went briefly to Germany to study algorithmic composition at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie in Karlsruhe.\nIn 1992, Miranda gained admittance to the Faculty of Music of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where he obtained his PhD in the combined fields of music and artificial intelligence in 1995. For his doctoral thesis, he focused on musical knowledge representation, machine learning of music and software sound synthesis.\n\n\n=== Experiences ===\nAfter receiving his PhD, Miranda worked at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC). At EPCC, he developed Chaosynth, an innovative granular synthesis software that uses cellular automata to generate complex sound spectra.\nIn the mid-1990s, Miranda joined the Department of Music at the University of Glasgow, where he lectured music technology and electroacoustic music composition for a number of years. Then he moved to Paris, to take up a research position at Sony Computer Science Laboratory in the late 1990s.\nAt Sony, Miranda conducted research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the fundamental cognitive mechanisms employed in sound-based communication systems. This research led Miranda to focus on the evolution of the human ability to speak and the role of our musical capacity in the development of spoken languages. While at Sony, Miranda filed patents in the field of speech processing and made scientific contributions in the fields of speech synthesis, evolutionary music (computational) and cognitive neural modeling.\nIn the early 2000s he was appointed Visiting Professor of Interactive Media Arts at MECAD (School of Media Arts and Design) in Barcelona and Adjunct Associate Professor of Computer Science at the American University of Paris.\nIn 2003 Miranda moved to the University of Plymouth in the UK where he presently is a full Professor in Computer Music and Head of the  Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR). He is also an active associate member of the Computer Music Lab at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in his native town of Porto Alegre.\n\n\n== Musical compositions ==\nMiranda's musical compositions have been broadcast and performed in a number of concerts and festivals worldwide, including the Festival Latino-Americano de Arte e Cultura (Brasília, 1987), the Encompor (Porto Alegre, 1988–89, 1995), the International Symposium for Electronic Arts (Minneapolis, 1993), the Festival Elektronischer Frühling (Vienna, 1993–94), and the Ciclo Acusmático (Bogotá, 1995). His music has won prizes and distinctions in Europe and South America, including awards at the Concours International de Musique Électroacoustique de Bourges (1994), the Concurso de Composição de Londrina (Brazil, 1995) and the Concorso Internazionale Luigi Russolo di Musica Elettroacustica (Italy, 1995, 1998). A review of his latest solo CD Mother Tongue, in The Wire magazine, reads, \"These are immensely sophisticated pieces that constitute an electronic global music of convincingly organic simplicity.\"\n\n\n== Scientific research ==\nMiranda is an active researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Music. He is currently conducting research into neuroscience of music and into simulations of biological natural processes in music origins and evolution. Miranda has turned to artificial life models to coax computers into composing music.\nJust as IBM's Deep Blue showed the world a computer can play chess as well as a human master, Miranda aims to demonstrate a computer program able to compose original music. So far, neural networks have succeeded in imitating distinct musical styles, but truly original compositions have remained elusive. Miranda is tackling this problem with an orchestra of virtual musician agents who interact to compose original music.\n\n\n== Published works ==\n\n\n=== Print (language) ===\n\n\n==== Published books ====\nMiranda, Eduardo Reck.

Kak has argued that there are limits to artificial intelligence and that it cannot match biological intelligence. Kak has been critical of the generalization of the quantum computing to commercial scale; he argues error correction is a significant challenge for scalability although it's fundamental to multi-purpose computing.\nKak is the Regents Professor of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater and an honorary visiting professor of engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is also an honorary visiting professor of media studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nOn 28 August 2018, he was appointed member of the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) in India.\n\n\n== Indology ==\n\n\n=== Indigenous Aryanism ===\nKak primarily advocates for an autochthonous origin of the Indo-Aryans from Punjab (\"Indigenous Aryans\" hypothesis) in contradiction of the scholarly consensus about the validity of Indo-Aryan migration theory; Kak reads the promotion of the latter theory to stem from racist tendencies. Scholars have noted his charges to be without any basis, lacking in any critical examination and primarily intended to promote Hindu supremacy.\n\n\n=== Ancient astronomy in the Rig Veda ===\nKak has also claimed to find evidences of advanced computing and astronomy in the Rig Veda, in what Noretta Koertge deems to be a \"social constructivist and postmodern attack on modern science\". He insists that Vedic scientists discovered the physical laws by Yogic meditation and that it is a valid scientific method which can be only evaluated within the paradigm of Vedic assumptions and by those who have attained Yogic enlightenment. According to Meera Nanda, Kak believes in the superiority of Hindus over Muslims. In a 2004 critique, she summarized some of Kak's views on the matter: according to Kak, Hindus built \"cultural empires\" without military conquest, in contrast to Muslim \"military empires\" reliant on conquest.\n\n\n=== Reviewed works ===\n\n\n==== Archaeoastronomy – The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda ====\nIn the book, Kak proposes that the organization of hymns in the Rig Veda was dictated by an astronomic code concerning the courses of planets—length of solar year and lunar year, the distance between sun and earth et al. He then leverages the proposition to argue for the existence of a tradition of sophisticated observational astronomy as far back as 3000 or 4000 BCE. Kak also states that the construction of fire-altars were a coded representation of their astronomic knowledge and that the Vedic civilisation were aware of the speed of light. He prepared the section on archaeoastronomical sites in India for the thematic study on Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention prepared for UNESCO by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\nWhile Kak's interpretation has been included in recent overviews of astronomy in the Vedic period in India and the West, his chronology and astronomical calculations have been critiqued by several Indologists, such as Michael Witzel, and the noted historian of mathematics Kim Plofker.\nKim Plofker rejected Kak's probabilistic analysis of the presence of planetary period numbers in the Rigveda's hymn number combinations, showing that Kak's apparent matches have \"no statistical significance whatever\". Witzel has rejected his analysis to be suffering from several shortcomings and questioned his usage of arbitrary multiplication factors to lead to the results. Kak's method depends on the structure of the Rigveda as redacted by the shakhas in the late Brahmana period, well within the Indian Iron Age, when it was organized into mandalas (\"books\"). According to Witzel, this leaves Kak's approach attempt to date the text flawed, because this process of redaction took place long after the composition of the individual hymns during the samhita prose period. Witzel concludes that the entire issue boiled down to an over-interpretation of some facts that were internally inconsistent and more, to the creativeness of Kak who was pre-motivated to find evidence of astronomy at every verse of Rig Veda. Meera Nanda criticized the arbitrary and absurd nature of Kak's analysis at length and noted his method to be \"breathtakingly ad hoc\" which \"reads like numerology.\" M A Mehendale, in a review over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, criticized the book for its many shortcomings which did not stand the scrutiny of rigor and remarked it to contain inaccurate and misleading statements. S. G. Dani, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize recipient rejected Kak's hypothesis as unscientific and highly speculative with extremely vague details and whose results were statistically insignificant.\nKlaus Klostermaier in his book A Survey of Hinduism praised Kak, for opening up an \"entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint\". Klostermaier's books have been heavily criticized for offering pro-Hindu views that have little currency in scholarship.\nKak's work influenced Raja Ram Mohan Roy's 1999 book Vedic Physics: Scientific Origin of Hinduism, which sought to prove that the RigVeda was coded per the laws of quantum and particle physics. Kak wrote the foreword to this book commending Roy's interpretations as a new way of looking at Vedic Physics. Meera Nanda, one of Kak's foremost critics, noted the result to be a \"shameful demeaning of physics as well as the Vedas\" and resembling \"ravings of mad men\".\n\n\n==== In Search of the Cradle of Civilization ====\nKak co-authored In Search of the Cradle of Civilization with Georg Feuerstein and David Frawley, equating the Vedic Aryans with the Harappans and thus, participating in the political controversy around the \"Indigenous Aryans\" theory. The chronology espoused in this book is based on the archaeoastronomical readings obtained by correlating textual references and archaeological remains.\nA review by Indian archaeologist M. K. Dhavalikar over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute noted it to be a \"beautifully printed\" contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses, but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained. Guy Beck showered glowing praises on the book in his review over the Yoga Journal. Klostermaier et al. praised the book. Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nEdwin Bryant calls him a well read and articulate spokesman for the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis and for other issues concerning ancient Indian science and culture.\nScholars have rejected his theories in entirety and his writings have been heavily criticized. Acute misrepresentation of facts coupled with wrong observations, extremely flexible and often self-contradictory analysis, cherry picking of data and forwarding of easily disprovable hypotheses have been located. His understanding of linguistics and subsequent assertion have been challenged. Romila Thapar calls Kak an amateur historian whose views on the Indus Civilization were fringe and who was part of a group that had more to do with waging political battles at the excuse of history. Michael Witzel noted him to be a revisionist and part of a \"closely knit, self-adulatory group\", members of which often write together and/or profusely copy from and cite one another, thus rendering the whole scene into a virtually indistinguishable hotchpotch. Garrett G. Fagan, a noted critic of pseudoarchaeology has concurred with Witzel. Meera Nanda writes about Kak being revered as a stalwart of Hindutva and one of the leading \"intellectual Kshatriyas\". Similar concerns of his being a Hindutva-based revisionist have been echoed by other writers. In a critique of faulty scientific reasoning in Hindutva ideologies and theories, Alan Sokal sarcastically criticized Kak as \"one of the leading intellectual luminaries of the Hindu-nationalist diaspora\". Koertge as well as Meera Nanda have remarked that Kak's work advances a Hindutva-based esoteric pseudoscience narrative that seeks to find relatively advanced abstract physics in Vedic texts and assign Indian indigenousness to the Sanskrit-speaking Indic Aryans in a bid to prove the superiority of the ancient Hindu civilization.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology\nNumber theoretic Hilbert transform\nScience wars\nUnary coding\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPublications on Physics and Computer Science in the ArXiv.org e-print archive\nDeccan Chronicle Interview\nTimes of India Interview by Aarti Tikoo Singh"

With David Haussler, he showed that machinery from computational learning theory including ε-nets and VC dimension could be useful in geometric problems such as the development of space-efficient range searching data structures. He devised linear time randomized algorithms for the smallest circle problem and for low-dimensional linear programming, and developed the combinatorial framework of LP-type problems that generalizes both of these problems. Other highly cited research publications by Welzl and his co-authors describe algorithms for constructing visibility graphs and using them to find shortest paths among obstacles in the plane, test whether two point sets can be mapped to each other by a combination of a geometric transformation and a small perturbation, and pioneer the use of space-filling curves for range query data structures.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nWelzl won the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 1995. He was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin in 1998. He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 1998,\nas a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 2005, of the Academia Europaea in 2006, and of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page at ETH Zurich"

        "context": "Eric \"Rick\" C. R. Hehner (born 16 September 1947) is a Canadian computer scientist. He was born in Ottawa. He studied mathematics and physics at Carleton University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in 1969. He studied computer science at the University of Toronto, graduating with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in 1970, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1974. He then joined the faculty there, becoming a full professor in 1983. He became the Bell University Chair in software engineering in 2001, and retired in 2012.\nHehner's main research area is formal methods of software design. His method, initially called predicative programming, later called Practical Theory of Programming, is to consider each specification to be a binary (boolean) expression, and each programming construct to be a binary expression specifying the effect of executing the programming construct. Refinement is just implication. This is the simplest formal method, and the most general, applying to sequential, parallel, stand-alone, communicating, terminating, nonterminating, natural-time, real-time, deterministic, and probabilistic programs, and includes time and space bounds. This idea has influenced other computer science researchers, including Tony Hoare.\nHehner's other research areas include probabilistic programming, unified algebra, and high-level circuit design. In 1979, Hehner invented a generalization of radix complement called quote notation, which is a representation of the rational numbers that allows easier arithmetic and precludes roundoff error.\nHe was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. and of IFIP Working Group 2.3 on Programming Methodology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHehner, E.

He was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in the second year of his PhD. Subsequently, he worked for the University of Bath (1982–85), the CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney (1985–88), the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1988–94), the University of Western Australia (where he was Professor of Statistics from 1994 to 2010), CSIRO Division of Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth (2010-2012), and the Centre for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia (2013-2014). He is now Professor of Computational Statistics at Curtin University.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Stereology ===\nClassical methods of stereology were limited by the requirement that the cutting plane be randomly oriented. Baddeley developed an alternative technique in which the cutting plane is \"vertical\" (parallel to a fixed axis, or perpendicular to a fixed surface) making it possible to apply quantitative microscopy to cylindrical core samples, samples of flat materials, and longitudinal sections.\nBaddeley is a leading advocate of statistical ideas in stereology. With Cruz-Orive he demonstrated the role of the Horvitz-Thompson weighting principle and the Rao-Blackwell theorem in stereological sampling.\n\n\n=== Spatial statistics ===\nBaddeley is one of the world leading specialists in point pattern analysis, a connection of stochastics and geometry applied to the analysis of (mainly) 2D point distributions in euclidean space. He has developed statistical methodologies for analyzing the structure of spatial patterns of points, including methods based on survival analysis, nonparametrics, new point process models, model-fitting principles (i.e. 'regression analysis' for point patterns) and algorithms and open-source software.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nJohn Curtin Distinguished Professor Award (2016)\nGeorges Matheron Lecturer (2008)\nPitman Medal (2004)\nHannan Medal (2001)\nCentenary Medal (2001)\nFellow, Australian Academy of Science (elected 2000)\nAustralian Mathematical Society Medal (1995)\nPrize Research Fellowship, Trinity College, Cambridge  (1979)\nSmith-Knight Prize, University of Cambridge  (1979)\nUniversity Medal, Australian National University (1976)\nStatistical Society of Australia Prize, Australian National University (1976)\nHanna Neumann Prize for Pure Mathematics, Australian National University (1976 and 1975)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian Baddeley\nAdrian Baddeley's former home page Archived 11 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine..."

        "context": "Douglas Bruce Kell  (born 7 April 1953) is a British biochemist and Professor of Systems Biology in the Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology at the University of Liverpool. He was previously at the School of Chemistry at the University of Manchester, based in the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB) where he founded and led the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology (MCISB). He served as chief executive officer (CEO) of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) from 2008 to 2013.\n\n\n== Education and early life ==\nKell was privately educated at Hydneye House in Sussex and Bradfield College in Berkshire where he was top scholar. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry in 1975 with a distinction in chemical pharmacology, where he was an undergraduate student of  St John's College, Oxford. He stayed in Oxford for his Doctor of Philosophy degree, completed in 1978 with a thesis on the bioenergetics of the microbe Paracoccus denitrificans, supervised by Stuart Ferguson and Philip John.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nFrom 1978 to 2002 he worked at Aberystwyth University, moving to the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) in 2002 as an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) / Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Research Chair in Bioanalytical Sciences. (UMIST merged with the Victoria University of Manchester in 2004, to become the University of Manchester.) He moved to the University of Liverpool in 2018 to work in the Johnston Laboratories, which were the world's first department of biochemistry at a University.\nKell's primary research interests are in systems biology, synthetic biology and computational biology. He has also been involved in the development of multivariate scientific instrumentation and the attendant machine learning software (his first paper on artificial neural networks was in 1992). He has written extensively on the role of microbes as agents of supposedly 'non-communicable', chronic infectious diseases. His publications are mostly open access and are very widely cited, with an H-index at Google Scholar in excess of 130. According to Google Scholar his most cited peer-reviewed research papers are in functional genomics, metabolomics and the yeast genome. He has also been involved in research to create a robot scientist in collaboration with Ross King, Stephen Muggleton and Steve Oliver, as well as several projects in systems biology. He is involved in the study of membrane transporters, and their necessary involvement in the transmembrane uptake of pharmaceutical drugs. He tends to choose scientific problems in which the prevailing orthodoxy is clearly incorrect. To this end, he has recently returned to the study of bioenergetics, summarising the detailed evidence against the prevailing wisdom of chemiosmotic coupling in oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation, replacing it with a protet-based model.\nWith his collaborator Resia Pretorius, Kell discovered the amyloidogenic clotting of blood, involving the amyloidogenic self-assembly of the clotting protein fibrin into highly stable β-sheets that — unlike regular clots — are resistant to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for breaking up clots (fibrinolysis). They report that such amyloidogenic clotting appears to be mostly caused by infectious agents, even in supposedly non-infectious diseases. Kell and Pretorius report that such fibrin amyloid microclots (fibrinaloids) seem to be of major significance in long COVID.\nIn 1988, he was a founding director of Aber Instruments, based at Aberystwyth Science Park (originally at the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT), Machynlleth, Wales). In 2019 he was a co-founding director of Mellizyme Ltd, now Epoch Biodesign; he left the company in 2023. He cofounded PhenUTest Ltd in 2021. He is an Associated Scientific Director of the Centre for Biosustainability at the Technical University of Denmark, where he runs the  Flux Optimisation and Bioanalytics Group.\nKell's research has been funded by the European Union (EU), the BBSRC, the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). His former doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers include Pedro Mendes. His monograph Belief: the baggage behind our being was published in 2018.\n\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\nKell was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours, for services to science and research. Kell is also a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (FLSW), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB) and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (FAAS).\n\n\n== References =="

Gurrin generated a database of over 18 million images, and produces about a terabyte of personal data a year. Gurrin and his researchers use information retrieval algorithms to segment his personal image archive into \"events\" such as eating, driving, etc. New events are recognised on a daily basis using machine learning. In an interview Gurrin said that \"If I need to remember where I left my keys, or where I parked my car, or what wine I drank at an event two years ago... the answers should all be there.\" While searching by date and time is easy, more complex searches within images such as looking for brand names and objects with complex form factors, such as keys, is more difficult.

While working at HP, he led the company's introduction of a new processor architecture, a corporate trust and security strategy,  and the company's entry into open source software. He was the public spokesman for HP's technology and one of the most visible figures in IT.  In 2002, RSA Security appointed DeMillo to its board of directors, a position he held until 2007 when RSA was acquired by EMC. He remained at HP through the company's 2002 merger with Compaq computer and was named Vice President for Technology Strategy. He returned to Tech that August to serve as the new dean of the College of Computing.\n\n\n== Georgia Tech ==\nArriving in 2002, DeMillo replaced Peter A. Freeman as Dean of the Georgia Tech College of Computing and led the college to a period of aggressive growth at a time when Computer Science enrollments were in decline nationally. He led the formation of 3 new schools, 7 new degree programs, 3 international programs, and 2 research centers. Under his tenure the ranking of Georgia Tech's graduate computer science programs rose from 14 to 9. He incorporated a broader focus into the College's undergraduate programs and launched a new program called \"Threads\", a student-centered approach to undergraduate education that has influenced computer science programs nationally and internationally.\nDeMillo was honored as an ACM Fellow in 2003 for \"contributions to the engineering of reliable and secure software.\" In 2004, he was also honored as an AAAS Fellow.\nIn June 2008, shortly after long-time Georgia Tech President Wayne Clough stepped down to become Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, DeMillo announced his resignation as Dean of the College of Computing. In 2010, he founded the Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U). In recognition of C21U as a \"unique institution\", the Lumina Foundation named him a Fellow in 2013.\nIn 2011, his book Abelard to Apple: The Fate of American Colleges and Universities  was published by MIT press and became the basis for the formation of a center dedicated to experimentation in higher education. He became a national leader in the online education revolution, and a sequel entitled \"Revolution in Higher Education: How a Small Band of Innovators Will Make College Accessible and Affordable: was published by MIT Press in 2015 and in 2016 was named best Education book by the American Publishers Association.\nIn 2016, he was given the ANAK Society's award, which is granted annually to an outstanding Georgia Tech faculty member, and  is considered the most prestigious award of its kind.\nin September 2020, he launched and served as first chair of Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, the first academic unit of its kind at a major research university.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCollege of Computing profile\nInstitute profile at the Wayback Machine (archived January 31, 2008)\nSelected Publications of Richard DeMillo\nInterview with Richard DeMillo and DeMillo's resignation letter\nRichard Allan DeMillo at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\n[1]"

Practically at the midpoint of the Iberian Peninsula's Atlantic coast, it is located at the mouth of the Mondego River, 40 km (25 mi) west of Coimbra and sheltered by hills (Serra da Boa Viagem), sharing about the same latitude with Philadelphia, Baku and Beijing. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 62,125, in an area of 379.05 km2 (146.35 sq mi). The city of Figueira da Foz proper has a population of 46,600. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.\nIt is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a tourism city, it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest casinos of the Iberian Peninsula – the Casino Figueira.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the legend, the place's name is due to a fig tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. Foz means \"place of discharge\", often used at the point a river meets another body of water, specially where there is a clear energy or water flow clash. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the Neolithic age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this, an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. Julião, to the cathedral Sé Velha of Coimbra.\nKnowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role in the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the shipbuilding and cod drying industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to vila (small town) on 12 March 1771 and turned city (cidade) on 20 September 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained a great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Portuguese nickname of Rainha das Praias (Queen of the Beaches).\nThe municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of Buarcos, the Serra da Boa Viagem – a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside promenade paved with typical Portuguese pavement. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with the archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the Santa Catarina Fort and the old Buarcos Fortress, the Relógio Tower by the main sandy beach, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of Abadias.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Navigator, formerly and still commonly known as Soporcel, and Celbi, part of Altri) and glass (Verallia, part of Saint-Gobain). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries. Until the turn of the 21st century, a factory of the CIMPOR Group was installed in the Mondeg..."

In 1996 he succeeded Ad Stouthamer as professor of microbiology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAt the beginning of his career Westerhoff worked in the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in relation to biological energy transduction. His work on this topic led to a book written with Karel Van Dam.\nAfter being a coauthor of one of the first experimental papers to stimulate interest in metabolic control analysis and participating in the group that proposed a harmonized terminology, Westerhoff moved progressively towards working on multi-enzyme systems as his major activity, starting with an analysis of the effect of enzyme activity on metabolite concentrations. He published many papers in this area, of which one may note an analysis of the control of regulatory cascades, analysqis of glycolytic oscilations in yeast, and showing that the in vivo behaviour of Trypanosoma brucei  agreed with the kinetic properties of the glycolytic enzymes.\nWesterhoff and colleagues discovered magainin in the African clawed frog which helps it fight against bacteria. In December 1996 he and his group discovered a nitric-oxide reductase of Paracoccus denitrificans. \nIn conjunction with many other workers Westerhoff used a community approach to construct a consensus yeast metabolic network and subsequently applied the same approach to human metabolism.\n\n\n== References =="

Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an assistant professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to associate professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.\nJenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.\nJenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers\n2011 Popular Science..."

His main research area is statistical learning theory. He has contributed to a number of fields ranging from graph theory through cryptography to statistical learning theory and its applications. However, his main contributions have been in the development of the analysis and subsequent algorithmic definition of principled machine learning algorithms founded in statistical learning theory. This work has helped to drive a fundamental rebirth in the field of machine learning with the introduction of kernel methods and support vector machines, including the mapping of these approaches onto novel domains including work in computer vision, document classification and brain scan analysis. More recently he has worked on interactive learning and reinforcement learning. He has also been instrumental in assembling a series of influential European Networks of Excellence (initially the NeuroCOLT projects and later the PASCAL networks). The scientific coordination of these projects has influenced a generation of researchers and promoted the widespread uptake of machine learning in both science and industry that we are currently witnessing. He has published over 300 papers with over 42000 citations. Two books co-authored with Nello Cristianini have become standard monographs for the study of kernel methods and support vector machines and together have attracted 21000 citations.

        "answer": "2008",
        "context": "Asad Ali Abidi (born July 12, 1956) is a Pakistani-American electrical engineer. He serves as a tenured professor at University of California, Los Angeles, and is the inaugural holder of the Abdus Salam Chair at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). He is best known for pioneering RF CMOS technology during the late 1980s to early 1990s. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices.\nAbidi received his B.S. from the Imperial College London followed by a M.S. and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981. He worked as an electrical engineer with Bell Labs and in January 1985 joined UCLA as a tenured academic. In 2007, he left for a three-year sabbatical to work as a founding dean of the engineering school at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and returned to Los Angeles in 2009. In 2017, he was named as the inaugural holder of the Abdus Salam Chair at LUMS.\nAbidi is a prominent academic and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and The World Academy of Sciences. He received the IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award in Solid-State Circuits in 2008. In 2015, UC, Berkeley recognised him as a distinguished alumnus for his contributions to the theory and practice of analog and RF circuits.\n\n\n== Life and education ==\nBorn and raised in Pakistan, Abidi was educated till matriculation at Cadet College Hasan Abdal, Pakistan, completed his high school from Dudley College of Technology, UK, and gained a B.Sc. degree (with first-class honours) in electrical engineering at Imperial College, London, in 1976. Later he attended University of California, Berkeley; he gained an M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering in 1978 and a Ph.D. in 1981 under the supervision of Robert Meyer. Abidi is an IEEE Fellow and a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering (NAE). He joined LUMS (Lahore University of Management Sciences) School of Science and Engineering as its first dean.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nSince 1985, Abidi has worked at UCLA, where he is currently a Distinguished Chancellor's Professor. From 1981 to 1984, he worked for Bell Laboratories as a Member of Technical Staff at the Advanced LSI Development Laboratory. He was a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Hewlett Packard Laboratories in 1989. He is one of only a few Pakistani-origin members of the NAE. and was recognized as an ISSCC top-ten author.\nWhile working at Bell and then UCLA, he pioneered radio research in metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology and made seminal contributions to radio architecture based on complementary MOS (CMOS) switched-capacitor (SC) technology. While working at Bell in the early 1980s, he worked on the development of sub-micron MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) VLSI (very large-scale integration) technology at the Advanced LSI Development Lab, along with Marty Lepselter, George E. Smith and Harry Bol. As one of the few circuit designers at the lab, Abidi demonstrated the potential of sub-micron NMOS integrated circuit technology in high-speed communication circuits, and developed the first MOS amplifiers for Gb/s data rates in optical fiber receivers. Abidi's work was initially met with skepticism from proponents of GaAs and bipolar junction transistors, the dominant technologies for high-speed circuits at the time. In 1985 he joined UCLA, where he pioneered RF CMOS technology during the late 1980s to early 1990s. His work changed the way in which RF circuits would be designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits.\nHe was a visiting researcher at HP Labs for a year in 1989, during which time he investigated A/D conversion at ultra-high speeds, before returning to UCLA and researching analog signal chains for disk drive read channels, high-speed A/D conversion, and analog CMOS circuits for signal processing and communications. Abidi, along with UCLA colleagues J. Chang and Michael Gaitan, demonstrated the first RF CMOS amplifier in 1993. In 1995, Abidi used CMOS switched-capacitor technology to demonstrate the first direct-conversion transceivers for digital communications.\nIn the late 1990s, the RF CMOS technology that he pioneered was widely adopted in wireless networking, as mobile phones began entering widespread use. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices.\nAbidi served as the Program Secretary for the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) from 1984 to 1990, and was the General Chairman of the Symposium on VLSI Circuits in 1992. He was the Secretary of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Council from 1990 to 1991. From 1992 to 1995, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n2013 Armstrong Memorial Lecturer, Columbia University\n2013 ISSCC Outstanding Contributor over its 60 years\n2012 Best Paper Award, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (co-winner)\n2012 ISSCC Distinguished Technical Paper Award\n2009 The World Academy of Sciences-TWAS\n2008 UCLA HSSEAS Lockheed Martin Award for Excellence in Teaching\n2008 IEEE Donald O.

        "answer": "2001",
        "context": "Herbert Edelsbrunner (born March 14, 1958) is a computer scientist working in the field of computational geometry, the Arts & Science Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics at Duke University, Professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), and the co-founder of Geomagic, Inc. He was the first of only three computer scientists to win the National Science Foundation's Alan T. Waterman Award.\n\n\n== Academic biography ==\nEdelsbrunner was born in 1958 in Graz, Austria. He received his Diplom in 1980 and Ph.D. in 1982, both from Graz University of Technology. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled Intersection Problems in Computational Geometry obtained under the supervision of Hermann Maurer. After a brief assistant professorship at Graz, he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1985, and moved to Duke University in 1999. In 1996, with Ping Fu (then director of visualization at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and his wife), he co-founded Geomagic, a company that develops shape modeling software. Since August 2009 he is Professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) in Klosterneuburg.\nIn 1991, Edelsbrunner received the Alan T. Waterman Award. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005, and received an honorary doctorate from Graz University of Technology in 2006. In 2008 he was elected to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.\nIn 2014 he became one of ten inaugural fellows of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. He is also a member of the Academia Europaea.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nEdelsbrunner has over 100 research publications and is an ISI highly cited researcher.\nHe has also published four books on computational geometry: Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry (Springer-Verlag, 1987, ISBN 978-3-540-13722-1), Geometry and Topology for Mesh Generation (Cambridge University Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0-521-79309-4), Computational Topology (American Mathematical Society, 2009, 978-0821849255) and A Short Course in Computational Geometry and Topology (Springer-Verlag, 2014, ISBN 978-3-319-05956-3).\nAs Edelsbrunner's Waterman Award citation states,\n\nDr. Edelsbrunner is a pioneer in the field of computational geometry. ... Dr. Edelsbrunner has had a tremendous impact on computational geometry by his own research as well as by his 1987 book Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry which systematized the field in its early days. This book is considered by many people to be still the best textbook and reference source on computational geometry.\n\n\n== Research contributions ==\nEdelsbrunner's most heavily cited research contribution is his work with Ernst Mücke on alpha shapes, a technique for defining a sequence of multiscale approximations to the shape of a three-dimensional point cloud.  In this technique, one varies a parameter alpha ranging from 0 to the diameter of the point cloud; for each value of the parameter, the shape is approximated as the union of line segments, triangles, and tetrahedra defined by 2, 3, or 4 of the points respectively such that there exists a sphere of radius at most alpha containing only the defining points.\nAnother heavily cited paper, also with Mücke, concerns “simulation of simplicity.” This is a technique for automatically converting algorithms that work only when their inputs are in general position (for instance, algorithms that may misbehave when some three input points are collinear) into algorithms that work robustly, correctly, and efficiently in the face of special-position inputs.\nEdelsbrunner has also made important contributions to algorithms for intersections of line segments, construction of K-sets, the ham sandwich theorem, Delaunay triangulation, point location, interval trees, fractional cascading, and protein docking.\n\n\n== References =="

He is a professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShelah was born in Jerusalem on July 3, 1945. He is the son of the Israeli poet and political activist Yonatan Ratosh. He received his PhD for his work on stable theories in 1969 from the Hebrew University.\nShelah is married to Yael, and has three children. His brother, magistrate judge Hamman Shelah was murdered along with his wife and daughter by an Egyptian soldier in the Ras Burqa massacre in 1985.\nShelah planned to be a scientist while at primary school, but initially was attracted to physics and biology, not mathematics. Later he found mathematical beauty in studying geometry: He said, \"But when I reached the ninth grade I began studying geometry and my eyes opened to that beauty—a system of demonstration and theorems based on a very small number of axioms which impressed me and captivated me.\" At the age of 15, he decided to become a mathematician, a choice cemented after reading Abraham Halevy Fraenkel's book An Introduction to Mathematics.\nHe received a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University in 1964, served in the Israel Defense Forces Army between 1964 and 1967, and obtained a M.Sc. from the Hebrew University (under the direction of Haim Gaifman) in 1967. He then worked as a teaching assistant at the Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem while completing a Ph.D. there under the supervision of Michael Oser Rabin, on a study of stable theories.\nShelah was a lecturer at Princeton University during 1969–70, and then worked as an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles during 1970–71. He became a professor at Hebrew University in 1974, a position he continues to hold.\nHe has been a visiting professor at the following universities: the University of Wisconsin (1977–78), the University of California, Berkeley (1978 and 1982), the University of Michigan (1984–85), at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia (1985), and Rutgers University, New Jersey (1985). He has been a distinguished visiting professor at Rutgers University since 1986.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nShelah's main interests lie in mathematical logic, model theory in particular, and in axiomatic set theory.\nIn model theory, he developed classification theory, which led him to a solution of Morley's problem. In set theory, he discovered the notion of proper forcing, an important tool in iterated forcing arguments. With PCF theory, he showed that in spite of the undecidability of the most basic questions of cardinal arithmetic (such as the continuum hypothesis), there are still highly nontrivial ZFC theorems about cardinal exponentiation. Shelah constructed a Jónsson group, an uncountable group for which every proper subgroup is countable. He showed that Whitehead's problem is independent of ZFC. He gave the first primitive recursive upper bound to van der Waerden's numbers V(C,N). He extended Arrow's impossibility theorem on voting systems.\nShelah's work has had a deep impact on model theory and set theory. The tools he developed for  his classification theory have been applied to a wide number of topics and problems in model theory and have led to great advances in stability theory and its uses in algebra and algebraic geometry as shown for example by Ehud Hrushovski and many others. Classification theory involves deep work developed in many dozens of  papers to completely solve the spectrum problem on classification of first order theories in terms of structure and number of nonisomorphic models, a huge tour de force. Following that he has extended the work far beyond first order theories, for example for abstract elementary classes. This work also has had important applications to algebra by works of Boris Zilber.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThree times speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (1974 invited, 1983 plenary, 1986 plenary)\nThe first recipient of the Erdős Prize, in 1977\nThe Karp Prize of the Association for Symbolic Logic in 1983\nThe Israel Prize, for mathematics, in 1998\nThe Bolyai Prize in 2000\nThe Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2001\nThe EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture in 2011\nThe Leroy P.

She is also co-editor-in-chief of two academic journals, Applied Mathematics & Optimization and Evolution Equations & Control Theory.\nLasiecka earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Andrzej Wierzbicki. In 2014, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to control theory of partial differential equations, mentorship, and service to professional societies.\"\nHer specific areas of study are partial differential equations and related control theory, non-Linear PDEs, the optimization theory, calculus of variations, and boundary stabilization.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIrena Lasiecka was born and raised in Poland, where she received her initial background in mathematics. She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nAfter receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of.\n\n\n== Areas of Study in Applied Mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Optimization ===\nOptimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions.\nThe work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations.\n\n\n=== Control theory ===\nControl Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\"\nIn simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal..."

        "answer": "Haifa, Israel",
        "context": "Nathan (Nati) Linial (born 1953 in Haifa, Israel) is an Israeli mathematician and computer scientist, a professor in the Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and an ISI highly cited researcher.\nLinial did his undergraduate studies at the Technion, and received his PhD in 1978 from the Hebrew University under the supervision of Micha Perles. He was a postgraduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles before returning to the Hebrew University as a faculty member.\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2019 he won the FOCS Test of Time Award for the paper \"Constant Depth Circuits, Fourier Transform, and Learnability\", co-authored with Yishay Mansour and Noam Nisan. \n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nLinial, Nati (1992), \"Locality in Distributed Graph Algorithms\", SIAM J. Comput., 21 (1): 193–201, CiteSeerX 10.1.1.471.6378, doi:10.1137/0221015. The paper won the 2013 Dijkstra Prize. In the words of the prize committee: \"This paper has had a major impact on distributed message-passing algorithms. It focused a spotlight on the notion of locality in distributed computation and raised interesting questions concerning the locality level of various distributed problems, in terms of their time complexity on different classes of networks. Towards that goal, in this paper, Linial developed a model particularly suitable for studying locality, which ignores message sizes, asynchrony and failures. This clean model allowed researchers to isolate the effects of locality and study the roles of distances and neighborhoods, as graph theoretic notions, and their interrelations with algorithmic and complexity-theoretic problems in distributed computing.\"\nBorodin, Allan; Linial, Nathan; Saks, Michael E. (1992), \"An optimal on-line algorithm for metrical task system\", J. ACM, 39 (4): 745–763, doi:10.1145/146585.146588, S2CID 18783826. This paper on competitive analysis of online algorithms studies metrical task systems, a very general model of tasks where decisions on how to service a sequence of requests must be made without knowledge of future requests. It introduces the metrical task system model, describes how to use it to model various scheduling problems, and develops an algorithm that in many situations can be shown to perform optimally.\nLinial, Nathan; Mansour, Yishay; Nisan, Noam (1993), \"Constant depth circuits, Fourier transform, and learnability\", J. ACM, 40 (3): 607–620, doi:10.1145/174130.174138, S2CID 16978276. By performing harmonic analysis on functions in the complexity class AC0 (a class representing highly parallelizable computational problems), Linial and his co-authors show that these functions behave poorly as pseudorandom number generators, can be approximated well by polynomials, and can be learned efficiently by machine learning systems.\nLinial, Nathan; London, Eran; Rabinovich, Yuri (1995), \"The geometry of graphs and some of its algorithmic applications\", Combinatorica, 15 (2): 215–245, doi:10.1007/BF01200757, S2CID 5071936. Linial's most-cited paper according to Google scholar, this paper explores connections between graph-theoretic problems such as the multi-commodity flow problem and low-distortion embeddings of metric spaces into low-dimensional spaces such as those given by the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma.\nHoory, Shlomo; Linial, Nathan; Wigderson, Avi (2006), \"Expander graphs and their applications\", Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 43 (4): 439–561, doi:10.1090/S0273-0979-06-01126-8, MR 2247919.

She is best known for her pioneering research in the fields of online communities and the learning sciences. In 1999, she was selected as one of MIT Technology Review's TR100 awardees, honoring 100 remarkable innovators under the age of 35.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAmy S. Bruckman was born in New York, New York. She attended the Horace Mann School, an Ivy Preparatory School in New York City, graduating in 1983. Following that, Bruckman attended Harvard University for her undergraduate studies, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics in 1987. She received a master's degree in 1991 from the Interactive Cinema Group at the MIT Media Lab, where she was advised by Glorianna Davenport. Her master's thesis described the Electronic Scrapbook, an intelligent home video editing system.\nBruckman went on to pursue a Ph.D. at the Media Lab in Mitchel Resnick's Epistemology and Learning Group. On January 20, 1993, Bruckman established MediaMOO, an online community for new media researchers and educators. The community, managed chiefly by Bruckman, developed a significant following for its time, eventually closing down seven years later. During this time, Bruckman also worked as a research assistant for Sherry Turkle on Turkle's influential book, Life on the Screen (1997). For her dissertation work, Bruckman developed MOOSE Crossing, a MOO-based constructionist learning environment in which young children could learn computer programming skills while building virtual objects.\n\n\n== Georgia Tech ==\nUpon her graduation from MIT in 1997, Bruckman accepted a position as an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing. As a new Georgia Tech faculty member, Bruckman founded the Electronic Learning Communities (ELC) Lab and began setting up a program of research incorporating her interests in online communities and constructionist learning. She founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) program at Georgia Tech in 1998, modeling it after MIT's UROP. In 1999, Bruckman's research was supported by a prestigious grant awarded by the National Science Foundation's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program. That same year, she was selected as one of Technology Review's 100 remarkable innovators under the age of 35. Her work at this time was described as \"the most notable MOO research in education.\"\nOn July 22, 1999, Bruckman and graduate student Joshua Berman released The Turing Game, a multiplayer online game inspired by the Turing test that challenged players to explore issues of online identity. The game received national attention and was played by over 11,000 people from 81 countries and all seven continents.\nIn 2003, Bruckman received tenure and was promoted to the position of associate professor. In 2012, she was made a full professor. She was the interim chair of the School of Interactive Computing from July 2017 until December.\nBruckman currently directs the ELC Lab, the UROC program, and the Web Science initiative at Georgia Tech. She has published dozens of scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals and has given invited presentations at high-profile academic conferences such as ICLS and CHI. Bruckman's most recent work, often done in conjunction with graduate students she advises, has dealt with topics in information ethics, game studies, social media use, computer-supported collaboration and wikis, and women in computing.\nHer book Should You Believe Wikipedia? was published in 2022.\n\n\n== Professional community  leadership ==\nBruckman has taken on many leadership roles in service to her professional community, notably for the ACM Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) conference. She was the General Co-chair for the 2013 conference and subsequently served as Chair of the CSCW Steering Committee.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2002, the American Educational Research Association presented Bruckman with the Jan Hawkins Award for Early Career Contributions to Humanistic Research and Scholarship in Learning Technologies.\nShe was elected to the CHI Academy in 2018.\nShe was also elected as an ACM Fellow in 2018 for \"contributions to collaborative computing and foundational work in Internet research ethics\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nConstructionism (learning theory)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmy Bruckman's Home Page at Georgia Tech\nELC Lab Home Page\nAmy S.

He is primarily known for his contributions to numerical analysis and has authored over 200 papers in his area and published four books.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGautschi was born December 11, 1927, in Basel, Switzerland, to Heinrich Gautschi (1901-1975). His paternal family originally hailed from Reinach. His patrilineal uncle, Adolf Eduard Gautschi, was a custodian and landscape painter. He had one twin brother Werner (1927-1959). He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Basel on the thesis Analyse graphischer Integrationsmethoden advised by Alexander Ostrowski and Andreas Speiser (1953).\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince then, he did postdoctoral work as a Janggen-Pöhn Research, Fellow at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo in Rome (1954) and at the Harvard Computation Laboratory (1955). He had positions at the National Bureau of Standards (1956–59), the American University in Washington, D.C., the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1959–63) before joining Purdue University where he has worked from 1963 to 2000 and now being professor emeritus. He has been a Fulbright Scholar at the Technical University of Munich (1970) and held visiting appointments at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1976), Argonne National Laboratory, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,  ETH Zurich (1996-2001), the University of Padova (1997), and the University of Basel (2000).\nAs well-known (e.g. Gerhard Wanner, Geneva c. 2011 and the well-known first-hand sources and subsequent reports such as Math. Intelligencer, etc), one of Gautschi's most important contributions on numerical simulation of special functions offered evidence and confidence to de Branges's tour-de-force attack on the elusive Bieberbach conjecture on the magnitude of coefficients of schlicht functions, which hitherto received only slow, difficult and partial progress by work of Bieberbach, Loewner, Gabaredian and Schiffer. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1960, Gautschi married Erika, who was previously married to his twin brother Werner (1927-1959). Werner was also an academic professor and lecturer and emigrated to the United States with his wife in 1956. After his sudden death, Erika returned to Switzerland, while being pregnant with her child to Basel where she met Walter and married him in 1960. They had three daughters;\n\nTheresa (1961-2018), married Ainsworth, two children; Emily Ainsworth (b. 1994) and Keith (b. 1997), formerly of Camas, Washington.\nDoris (b. 1965)\nCaroline Cari (b. 1969)\nThrough his predeceased twin brother, he has stepson/nephew, Thomas (b. 1960).

The topics of this book are algorithms for, and the combinatorial geometry of, arrangements of lines and arrangements of more general types of curves in the Euclidean plane and the real projective plane. The topics covered in this monograph include Davenport–Schinzel sequences and their application to the complexity of single cells in arrangements, levels in arrangements, algorithms for building arrangements in part or in whole, and ray shooting in arrangements.\nDavenport–Schinzel Sequences and Their Geometric Applications (with Micha Sharir, Cambridge University Press, 1995, ISBN 978-0-521-47025-4). This book concerns Davenport–Schinzel sequences, sequences of symbols drawn from a given alphabet with the property that no subsequence of more than some finite length consists of two alternating symbols. As the book discusses, these sequences and combinatorial bounds on their length have many applications in combinatorial and computational geometry, including bounds on lower envelopes of sets of functions, single cells in arrangements, shortest paths, and dynamically changing geometric structures.\nCombinatorial Geometry (with János Pach, Wiley, 1995, ISBN 978-0-471-58890-0). This book, less specialized than the prior two, is split into two sections. The first, on packing and covering problems, includes topics such as Minkowski's theorem, sphere packing, the representation of planar graphs by tangent circles, the planar separator theorem. The second section, although mainly concerning arrangements, also includes topics from extremal graph theory, Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension, and discrepancy theory.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nAgarwal was elected as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2002.

He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.\n\n\n== Education ==\nStanley obtained his B.A. in physics at Wesleyan University in 1962.\nHe performed biological physics research with Max Delbrück in 1963 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1967.\nStanley was a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley  with Charles Kittel, where he wrote an Oxford monograph \nIntroduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena which won the\nChoice Award for Outstanding Academic Book of 1971.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nStanley was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971.  He was appointed Hermann von Helmholtz Associate Professor in 1973, in recognition of his interdepartmental teaching and research with the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. In 1976, Stanley joined Boston University as Professor of Physics, and Associate Professor of Physiology (in the School of Medicine).  In 1978 and 1979, he was promoted to Professor of Physiology and University Professor, respectively.  Since 2007 he holds joint appointments with the Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering Departments. In 2011, he was made William F. Warren Distinguished Professor. In the spring of 2013, he held the Lorentz Professorship at the University of Leiden.\n\n\n== Research and achievements ==\nStanley had fundamental contributions to several topics in statistical physics, such as the theory of phase transitions, percolation, disordered systems, aggregation phenomena, polymers, econophysics and biological physics. His early work introduced the n-vector model of magnetism and its exact solution in the limit nà infinity, topics that are now part of standard statistical physics textbooks.\nHis seminal work on liquid water started with a percolation model he developed in 1980 with José Teixeira to explain the experimentally observed anticorrelations in entropy and volume. In 1992 he developed the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis, that offered a quantitative understanding of water’s anomalies,  applying to all liquids with tetrahedral symmetry (such as silicon and silica). Direct experimental proof for his proposal was obtained by recent experiments in Tsukuba, MIT, and Stanford.\nStanley introduced the term ‘econophysics’ in 1994 to describe the interdisciplinary field merging physics principles with economic phenomena. His research group has identified empirical laws governing economic fluctuations and developed statistical mechanics models to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.  \nThe ISI Web of Science, lists 76,778 citations to Stanley's work (excluding 33 books). Using the Hirsch H Index metric for publication impact [PNAS 102, 16569 (2005)], Stanley has authored 129 papers with a citation count equal to or greater than 129, so H = 129.

He was with Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, Colorado, for almost 21 years, where he is a Professor Emeritus. He was elevated to Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  for applications of artificial intelligence in control of power electronics systems.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSimões was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 1963, to José L.G. Simões and Cecília A.B.G. Simões, with a sister, Maysa A.G. Simões. When he was 11 years old, he had a strong motivation and decided to become an electrical engineer when his cousin, Hélio Adauto de Paula, showed him vacuum tube radios, transistorized audio amplifiers, and took Simões to visit his work as an electrical machine designer in Equacional, a motor manufacturing company in the city of São Paulo.\nSimões was enrolled in an evening Catholic high school from 1978 to 1980, \"Liceu Coração de Jesus\", where he learned electronics as part of a technician degree. At that time, there was a job market for electronic technicians in Brazil, but he wanted to study further, and become an engineer. Therefore, in 1980, Simões took the entrance exams (FUVEST) for the University of São Paulo (USP) and was admitted as a student in \"Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (EPUSP)\". He completed his B.Sc. degree in 1985. In 1982 he was admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of EPUSP and started an internship at FDTE - Fundação para o Desenvolvimento Tecnológico da Engenharia. From 1984 to 1985, he focused his expertise in telecommunications, antennas, high frequency, analog, and digital circuits design. His Senior Design in 1985 was a modem with analog and digital circuits implemented for interfacing an 8085 microprocessor, operating on a regular telephone connection. Such a system was made before the age of computers connected on telephone lines via modems. During his four years internship for FDTE, he was learning with senior engineers how to design DC-DC converters and off-line switching mode power supplies, using Phillips manuals for TV flyback circuits and National Instruments handbooks. Those power converters were built and implemented in railroad automation (FEPASA), as well as in the São Paulo Metro subway system. In 1985 Simões graduated from EPUSP and worked as an engineer for a few years with FDTE. He was inspired by several faculty from EPUSP, for example, Prof. Luiz de Queiroz Orsini who taught him modern computer-based electrical and electronics circuits analysis (that time with mainframes, and later on MAC's and PC's), José Roberto Cardoso who taught electrical machines and energy conversion. Simões also learned a lot from Prof. Edson Benedicto Ramos Féris and Prof. Guido Stolfi techniques for analog high-frequency circuit designer. During the Senior year (1985) Simões attended a course from Prof. Waldir Pó on introduction to Power Electronics, where the principles of utilizing thyristors, diodes, and transistors, to control electrical circuits for energy conversion was a transformation in how Simões wanted to further his career, giving him a strong motivation to learn and understand power electronics for controlling machines, ac-dc, dc-ac, and dc-dc power conversion.\nFrom 1986 to 1989, Simões worked for FDTE, at the same time leading technical research with three other partners wh..."

        "context": "Marcia J. Bates (born 1942) is Professor VI Emerita of Information Studies in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBates received an MLS in 1967 and a PhD (1972), both from the University of California, Berkeley.\nShe previously taught at the University of Maryland, College Park and was tenured at the University of Washington in 1981 before joining the faculty at UCLA. Bates has published on information seeking behavior, search strategy, subject access in manual and automated systems, and user-centered design of information retrieval systems. She is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a recipient of the American Society for Information Science Research Award, 1998, Award of Merit , 2005, and has twice received the American Society for Information Science \"Best Journal of ASIS Paper of the Year Award,\" in 1980 and 2000. In 2001 she received the Frederick G. Kilgour Award for Research in Library and Information Technology.\nBates' early work dealt with searching success and failure in library catalogs.  She initially became known for her articles on information search tactics, that is, techniques and heuristics for improving retrieval success in information systems.\nShe was Editor-in-Chief  of the  Third Edition of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences (Taylor & Francis, 2010).\n\n\n== Research ==\nMany of Bates' contributions have been in the area of user-centered information system design. Several of her papers have been widely cited and used, including articles on her concepts of \"berrypicking,\" of \"information search tactics,\" and the \"cascade of interactions\" in the user-system interface. In 2017, Ali Shiri did an extensive analysis of Bates' major articles, determining who cited her work and why. He found that she had had considerable impact on information system design.\nIn conjunction with the Getty Research Institute, and other Getty agencies, she has studied humanities information seeking online extensively, producing six articles on the work. In subject access, as early as 1985, she designed and argued for a \"cluster thesaurus\" that would bring together all the syntactic and semantic variants of a concept under each concept. Searches could then match on any term in the cluster, with the searcher able to select subsets of terms for further searching. This was also known as the \"front-end system mind.\"\nBates takes an evolutionary approach to the development of human and animal information and knowledge. She argues that \"information is the pattern of organization of matter and energy.\" The recognition and transmission of these patterns has developed evolutionarily, leading to the point where human beings have become able to recognize quite sophisticated patterns, such as language constructions, and patterns of behavior such as \"bait and switch.\" She also defines types of information useful for the information professions, such as \"embodied information,\" \"encoded information,\" \"embedded information,\" and \"recorded information.\" which marks a change from the definition of information in communication theory. The communication model sees information as the flow and exchange of a message, originating from one speaker, mind, or source and received by another. According to Ronald Day, \"Implicit in this standard model of information are such notions as the intentionality of the speaker, the self-evident 'presence' of that intention in his or her words, a set of hearers or users who receive the information and who demonstrate the correctness of that reception in action or use, and the freedom of choice in regards to the speaker's ability to say one thing rather than another, as well as even the receivers freedom of choice to receive one message rather than another in the marketplace of ideas.\"\nBates claims (drawing on S. Goonatilake) that there are three fundamental channels of information: genetic, neural-cultural, and exosomatic.\nIn response to the rapid transformations in libraries and in information science, Bates has also written on the nature of the information disciplines. The design of the encyclopedia she and Maack edited also reflects her arguments about the nature of the information disciplines.\nAccording to Google Scholar Bates' work has been cited over 13,000 times. Cronin & Meho found that she ranked 3rd in a list of 31 influential information scientists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBates' Faculty Website\nUCLA Department of Information Studies"

He received his MA in 1987 at the University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Philosophy for the thesis Machine intelligence and Explication, and his PhD in 1990 at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, under supervision of Reinder Pieter van de Riet for the thesis Algebraic Foundations for Dynamic Conceptual Models.\nAfter finishing his PhD, he continued to work at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Vrije Universiteit. In 1998 he joined the Department of Computer Science of the University of Twente as Professor of Information Systems. From 2006 to 2011 he was Scientific Director of the School of Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS), and from 2009 to 2012 he headed the computer science department at the University of Twente.\nCirca 1996, Wieringa and Frank Dehne wrote the Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling, for Wieringa's conceptual modeling courses and book, Requirements Engineering: Frameworks for Understanding.\nWieringa has been Associate Editor in Chief of the IEEE Software journal from 2004 to 2007, and was member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Business Information Systems, the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling, and the Requirements Engineering Journal.\nIn 2019, Wieringa retired from academia, and now works and blogs at The Value Engineers, which was founded in 2017 with Jaap Gordijn and Dan Ionita.\n\n\n== The engineering cycle ==\n\nThe engineering cycle is a framework used in Design Science for Information Systems and Software Engineering, proposed by Roel Wieringa in his book \"Design Science Methodology for Information Systems and Software Engineering\".\nThe engineering cycle consists of:\n\nProblem investigation.\nTreatment design.\nTreatment validation.\nTreatment implementation.\nImplementation evaluation.\nThe design cycle consists of the first 3 tasks of the engineering cycle: investigation, design, and validation.\nThe engineering and design cycles do not prescribe a mandatory, rigid sequence of activities. Moreover, they are often applied recursively for sub-problems of the main research objective.\nThe engineering cycle and the design cycle are often applied in several iterations (hence “cycle”). In such a case, the evaluation may become the investigation part of the next engineering cycle.\n\n\n=== Validation vs. evaluation in the engineering cycle ===\nAccording to the Design science methodology of (Wieringa, 2014), validation is part of the design cycle. It involves checking if the designed artifacts support the initial assumptions. It is executed in a theoretical, “laboratory” environment; such as through discussions and interviews with practitioners and experts. Validation is executed before the implementation in practice.\nOn the other hand, evaluation is executed after the implementation in practice of the designs. It involves analyzing the behavior, effects, and impact of the designed artifacts in practice, in the field. In our case, this meant implementation and analysis of the designs in actual, industry IT projects.\nStefan Morcov proposes a parallel between these 2 activities and a similar framework, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) model. The TRL model was proposed by NASA and is currently also widely applied in the European Union's research programs such as Horizon. Thus, validation leads to TRL level 4 - “Technology validated in a laboratory environment”; while evaluation leads to a TRL level 6 - “Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment”.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nBooks, a selection\n\n1990.

        "context": "Megan Squire is a professor of computer science at Elon University. A researcher and Anti-Defamation League fellow with a focus on right-wing political extremism online, her work has been described as operating as an intermediary between non-profits like the Southern Poverty Law Center and militant groups on the far-left.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nSquire grew up in a conservative Christian household near Virginia Beach, Virginia. She attended the College of William & Mary, where she earned a double major in art history and public policy. She took a secretarial job at an antivirus software company after becoming interested in computers. After receiving her PhD from Nova Southeastern University in Florida, she worked at a startup in North Carolina and then began teaching at Elon University.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSquire's research focuses on how online extremism is mediated by social media networks, including Telegram, Facebook, and other platforms.\nSquire performed research in 2018 on anti-Muslim Facebook groups, using Facebook's Graph API to create a dataset of 700,000 members from 1,870 open and closed groups with ideologies including anti-Muslim, white nationalist, neo-Confederate, and more. The data was gathered over ten months. She found that membership in one such group correlated highly with the chance of being in another group, indicating that anti-Muslim sentiment acted as a \"common denominator\" for membership in related groups. Her research has been cited in lawsuits against Facebook for failing to remove such groups.\nShe has also explored how the younger generation of far right extremists, including Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey, use video livestreaming and gaming platforms to earn money. A study in November 2020 showed that a handful of leaders of the global white nationalist movement are raising significant sums of money. As of November 2020, Squires' research indicated that Fuentes was earning about $326 per day off of DLive, or about $119,000 per year. \"Most donations are small amounts of money, but some donors give very, very large amounts...Some users are giving $10,000 to $20,000 a month to streamers on Dlive.\" Her research using trace data from Venmo showed that the Proud Boys were taking dues despite claims to the contrary.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nSquire first engaged in activism at age 15, when she joined her school environmental club to protest pollution at an industrial cattle farm. While teaching at Elon, she protested the war in Iraq. In 2008, Squire campaigned for the future US President Obama; however, following Obama's handling of the Great Recession, Squire became disillusioned with electoral politics and began engaging with the Occupy movement.\nThough she doesn't consider herself to be part of the Antifa movement, they have been said to be among her \"strongest allies\" and she is \"unwilling\" to condemn the use of political violence.\nAmid a rise in fascist and neo-Nazi pamphleting of college campuses, Squire put together an interactive map of such events. By 14 November 2017, she had documented over 200 such occurrences.\nAt an anti-racism protest outside the Alamance County Courthouse in downtown Graham, Squire was assaulted by two members of a pro-Confederate monument group described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Both assailants were arrested and charged, one charged for assault on a female and the other for disorderly conduct.\n\n\n== Honors and recognitions ==\nIn 2019, her presentation \"Understanding Gray Networks Using Social Media Trace Data\" was named runner-up for Best Paper at the International Conference on Social Informatics. In 2022, Squire was named a Belfer Fellow by the Anti-Defamation League for her work to \"collect, analyze, and visualize quantitative data from social media platforms to understand the impact of various types and levels of deplatforming and demonetization on far-right individuals and groups.\" She is also a Fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\n== References =="

He is professor of computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and director and founder of the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLeymann studied Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and received a Master of Science degree in Mathematics (i.e. Dipl.-Math.) in 1982 from University of Bochum, Germany. He worked as research staff member in the Faculty of Mathematics at University of Bochum, where he obtained his PhD in Mathematics (i.e. Dr. rer. nat.) in 1984. In his PhD thesis he studied foliations on spaces with singularities. After his PhD he went to IBM Research and Development contributing to software products like DB2, Websphere, or MQSeries. Leymann was main co-inventor and chief software architect of IBM's business process management and workflow products, and was appointed IBM Distinguished Engineer for this work. In 2004, he was appointed full professor of computer science at University of Stuttgart where he founded the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems. He holds many granted patents in the area of software.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFrank Leymann's main contributions are from the domains of workflow systems, service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, pattern languages and quantum computing.\n\n\n=== Database management ===\nHis initial focus was on database technology:  \nIn order to simplify queries on relational databases with many tables, Leymann co-developed a universal relation system\non top of existing relational database systems. Contributions to architectural aspects of stored procedures and user defined functions followed. The latter resulted in investigating the use of object databases, especially ObjectStore, as the underpinning of other middleware. At this time, developers were quite unfamiliar with object databases, thus, Leymann helped to create tooling to ensure proper performance of corresponding applications.\n\n\n=== Business process management & workflow systems ===\nWorkflow systems support companies in modeling, optimizing, and executing their business processes in computing environments. Several languages have been proposed for modeling business processes, out which two languages are widely supported in industry: one of which is the OASIS (organization) standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) that Leymann co-invented and which in turn is based on Web Services Flow Language (WSFL), a language that Leymann authored for IBM; the other language is Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), which Leymann co-author too. Such modeling languages support \"programming in the large \" and allow splitting high-level logic of control- and data flow within an overall application from its low-level logic implementing elementary business functions; this way, workflow-based applications can be created, that allow changing business processes without having to change the programs implementing individual steps of the process. \nOften, collections of such steps represent long running transactions, i.e. performed steps must succeed or - in case of an error - must be collectively undone; to support this behavior in business processes Leymann introduced compensating transactions in workflow systems\nBased on his contributions to IBM's workflow products, Leymann co-authored the seminal book \"Production Workflow\" that explains how to build scalable and reliable workflow system..."

        "question": "Where was the contributor who published Distributing Bits and Atoms born?",
        "answer": "MIT",
        "context": "Neil Adam Gershenfeld (born December 1, 1959) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. Scientific American has named Gershenfeld one of their \"Scientific American 50\" for 2004 and has also named him Communications Research Leader of the Year. Gershenfeld is also known for releasing the Great Invention Kit in 2008, a construction set that users can manipulate to create various objects.\nGershenfeld has been featured in a variety of newspapers and magazines such as The New York Times and The Economist, and on NPR.\nHe was named as one of the 40 modern-day Leonardos by the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. Prospect named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGershenfeld was born on September 1, 1959, in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. He attended Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, then Swarthmore College, where he graduated in 1981 with a B.A. degree in physics with high honors. In 1990, he earned a Ph.D. in physics at Cornell University, titled Representation of chaos.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nIn 1998, Gershenfeld started a class at MIT called \"How to make (almost) anything\". Gershenfeld wanted to introduce expensive, industrial-size machines to the technical students. However, this class attracted a lot of students from various backgrounds: artists, architects, designers, students without any technical background. In his interview to CNN, Gershenfeld said that \"the students... were answering a question I didn't ask, which is: What is this stuff good for? And the answer is: Not to make what you can buy in stores, but to make what you can't buy in stores. It's to personalise fabrication\". Gershenfeld believes that this is the beginning of a new revolution: digital revolution in fabrication that will allow people to fabricate things, machines on demand.\nGershenfeld has presented his course on \"How to make (almost) anything\" at the Association of Professional Model Makers (APMM) 2010 Conference.\nThis class later has led Gershenfeld to create Fab lab in collaboration with Bakhtiar Mikhak at MIT. Gershenfeld feels very passionate about this project, as he believes that teaching kids how to use technology and create it themselves will empower the future generations to become more independent and create technology that each individual community needs, not a technology that is currently available on the market. Fab labs have spread around the world, having been established in the remotest of places and countries. In his interview with Discover magazine on the question what personal fabrication might be useful for, Gershenfeld said, \"There is a surprising need for emergent technologies in many of the least developed places on the planet. While our needs might be fairly well met, there are billions of people on the planet whose needs are not. Their problems don't need incremental tweaks in current technology, but a revolution\".\nAs well as \"How to make (almost) anything\" class, Gershenfeld has started teaching the following classes: \"How To Make Something That Makes (almost) Anything\", \"The Physics of Information Technology\", \"The Nature of Mathematical Modeling\".\nGershenfeld has been a keynote speaker at the Congress of Science and Technology Leaders (2015, 2016).\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nNeil Gershenfeld is the director for MIT's Centre for Bits and Atoms. His research lab's work has been published in Science as well as in The American Physical Society journal. Amongst many is the research on Experimental Implementation of Fast Quantum Searching, Microfluidic Bubble Logic research, Physical one-way functions.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGershenfeld, Neil (1999).

He has made numerous contributions to wireless communications, signal processing, information theory, and coding.  Much of his research has centered on understanding how feedback and other forms of side information can be utilized during communication. \n\n\n== Early Life and Education ==\nLove completed his B.S. (with Highest Honors) and M.S. degrees, both in electrical engineering, at the University of Texas at Austin in 2000 and 2002, respectively.  He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UT Austin in 2004 under the supervision of Robert W. Heath Jr. During his M.S. and Ph.D., Love developed the paradigm of codebook-based limited feedback, which has become a key technology in almost all modern communication systems.\n\n\n== Professional Career ==\nLove was appointed as an assistant professor at Purdue University in 2004. In 2009, he was promoted to associate professor, and in 2013, he was made full professor. In 2012, he was recognized as a University Faculty Scholar at Purdue.

He has made numerous contributions to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, millimeter wave communication, feedback-based communication, broadband communication, low-EM exposure techniques, non-orthogonal multiple access, sensing, and software defined radios and networks.\nStarting at UT Austin, Love and Heath pioneered multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) feedback strategies in particularly inventing limited feedback precoding, a form of which is currently found in IEEE 802.11 WLAN, Wimax cellular, LTE, and 5G NR cellular standards. They showed that codebook-based beamforming is related to the famous applied mathematics problem of Grassmannian line packing. They also showed how MIMO precoding also can be understood as subspace packing.\nWorking with collaborators, he showed how communication at millimeter wave frequencies can be understood as a form of beam alignment.  This viewpoint became widespread in both academia and industry.  Beam-based communication at millimeter wave frequencies is included in 5G.   \nWorking with James Krogmeier and students at Purdue, Love made numerous contributions to software defined radio (SDR) and software defined networks.  He co-advised a team in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) that finished in the top-ten in the first phase event, top-five in the second phase event, and eleventh in the final phase.  Previously, he co-advised the Purdue team that was a finalist in the DARPA Spectrum Challenge.\n\n\n== Professional Activities ==\nLove is a Fellow of the IEEE. He has been particularly involved in the Signal Processing Society, Communication Society, Information Theory Society, and the Vehicular Technology Society branches of the organization.

        "answer": "Hohengehren, Germany",
        "context": "Wolfgang Tschacher (born 1956 in Hohengehren, Germany) is a Swiss psychologist and university lecturer. He is professor at the University of Bern.., Switzerland. He has conducted theoretical and empirical research in the fields of psychotherapy and psychopathology, especially from a systems-theoretical perspective that includes self-organization and complexity theory. He is active in the development of time series methods for the modeling of psychotherapeutic processes and generally social systems. \nA focus of this research is the theory of embodiment (or, 4E cognition), nonverbal synchrony of social interaction, and generally the relationship between mind and body. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter completing studies in psychology, which contained a Psychiatry internship at the Veterans Administration Hospital (Montrose, NY) and courses in philosophy at the University of Tübingen, he received his PhD in psychology in 1990. He worked as family therapist and post-doc scientist in Tübingen. In 1992, he moved to Bern (Switzerland) where he assumed the position of head of research at the University Hospital of Social Psychiatry, directed by Prof. Luc Ciompi. Tschacher founded, in 2002, the department of Psychotherapy at the Universitäre Psychiatrische Dienste Bern (UPD).\nWolfgang Tschacher was among the founders of the Society for Mind-Matter Research, where he currently acts on the board of directors. From 2007 to 2010 he was president of the European Chapter of the Society for Psychotherapy Research (SPR). He is also a founding member of the ethics committee of the Canton of Bern. In 2018, he held a fellowship at the Freiburg Institute of Advanced Studies (FRIAS) at the University of Freiburg, Germany. He is father to three sons and lives in Bern.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn a team with Günter Schiepek, Ewald Johannes Brunner and Jean-Pierre Dauwalder, Tschacher initiated the series of \"Herbstakademie\" (Autumn Academy) conferences since 1990. These conferences are centered on the application of synergetics, systems theory, and embodiment to psychology and the social sciences. Until 2019, 20 Herbstakademie conferences have been held in cooperation with Hermann Haken, covering themes such as \"Embodied Cognition\" (2000, in Ascona) with keynotes by Andy Clark, Thomas Metzinger and Esther Thelen, \"Embodied Cognition and Embodied Communication\" (2009, in Bern) with keynotes by Karl Friston and Karl Grammer, or \"Embodied Aesthetics\" (2017) at the University of Heidelberg with keynotes by Thomas Fuchs, Vittorio Gallese, and Winfried Menninghaus. Since the 1990s, Tschacher pioneered empirical work in systemic psychotherapy, for instance in the context of the Heidelberg Systemic Research Conferences\nIn his habilitation work «Prozessgestalten» (1997) Tschacher had already addressed the application of dynamical systems and complexity theory to various fields of psychology. He thereby merged the current discussion in psychology with the tradition of Gestalt theory, putting at the center pattern-formation processes and temporal dynamics. This general approach was further elaborated by his cooperation with Hermann Haken subsumed in the book «The Process of Psychotherapy» (2019).. In this work, therapy process was modeled as a synergy of stochastic and deterministic forces, which create and modify the stability of clients' and therapists' states. In terms of systems theory, this can be described by stochastic and deterministic forces acting on dynamical attractors. Based on theoretical and mathematical considerations, Tschacher and Haken proposed a \"minimal model\" of psychotherapeutic interaction, which has implications for effective interventions. According to their \"Archimedean function\", therapists should be slow, mindful, and resilient in order to be effective. The cooperation with Haken also yielded philosophical results in a complexity-science formulation of intentionality\nStarting in 2008, Wolfgang Tschacher joined the Projekt «eMotion – Mapping Museum Experience» that was initiated by the art researcher Martin Tröndle. The eMotion project, supported by the Swiss National Fund, aimed at observing aesthetic perception in the fine arts museum where the locomotion and physiological arousal of visitors was visualized by a \"psychogeographical\" method. Also in collaboration with Martin Tröndle, Tschacher is involved in the research project «Experimental Concert Research» funded since 2019 by the Volkswagenstiftung, which extends the art-psychological empirical approach to aesthetic experiences and physiological synchrony in the classical concert. \nIn the fields of psychotherapy and psychiatry, Tschacher is concerned with implications of the embodiment approach, as for example in collaborations with Karl Friston in applications of predictive coding in schizophrenia research, with Sander Koole and Fabian Ramseyer in research on nonverbal synchrony in social interaction and therapy. Numerous publications have shown that individuals tend to synchronize their body movement and physiology during interaction, which is a type of pattern formation that generally occurs outside the interactors' awareness. As a spin-off to this work, algorithms have been developed that allow computing signatures of synchrony based on time series, such as Surrogate Synchrony (SUSY) and Surrogate Concordance (SUCO). weblink The FRIAS project «Embodied communication and its basis in nonverbal synchrony» was influenced by Tschacher's embodiment and synchrony approach. This work was also disseminated to a wider audience interested in psychotherapy, business communication, and dance and movement therapy. As member of a group of experts, Tschacher presented his embodiment approach in a major television science broadcast\nWith his research group in Bern, Tschacher developed a questionnaire for the comprehensive assessment of mindfulness, the «CHIME». \n\n\n== Publications ==\nW.

In particular, he made significant contributions in terms of systematic applications of the replica method to disordered systems, even though the replica method itself was originally discovered in 1971 by Sir Sam Edwards.\nHe has also contributed to the field of elementary particle physics, in particular to quantum chromodynamics and string theory. Together with Guido Altarelli, he introduced the so-called Dokshitzer–Gribov–Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi equations. In the field of fluid dynamics he is known for having introduced, together with Uriel Frisch, multifractal models to describe the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulent flows. He is also known for the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation modelling stochastic aggregation. From the point of view of complex systems, he worked on the collective motion of animals (such as swarms and flocks). He also introduced, together with other Italian physicists, the concept of stochastic resonance in the study of climate change.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n\nGiorgio Parisi is a foreign member of the French Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFeltrinelli Prize, 1986.\"Premi Antonio Feltrinelli\". 15 May 2021.

He was also affiliated with the program in Applied and Computational Mathematics. He was dismissed from the faculty following a university investigation of alleged sexual misconduct.\nVerdu received the Telecommunications Engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1980 and the PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1984. Conducted at the Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of Illinois, his doctoral research was supervised by Vincent Poor and pioneered the field of multiuser detection. In 1998, his book Multiuser Detection was published by Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n== Sexual harassment incident and dismissal from tenured position ==\nA Title IX investigation by Princeton, made public in 2017 by the Huffington Post, concluded that Verdú had sexually harassed one of his graduate students, a South Korean woman. According to the student, Verdú was required only to attend an 8-hour training session as a consequence. The student changed advisers and changed her research topic. A university spokesperson denied the claim that additional training was the only consequence for Verdú, stating that \"penalties were imposed in addition to the required counseling\", but did not identify what those penalties were. According to the Princeton Dean of Faculty, there were allegations that Verdú had also harassed others, but only the one student was willing to make a formal complaint. Verdú denied the findings of the investigation, stating: \"The university advised me not to reply but I categorically deny that there were any advances or any sexual harassment.\"\nHe was subsequently dismissed from Princeton University as of September 22, 2018, following further consideration by the university, which said that \"an investigation established that Dr. Verdu violated the university's policy prohibiting consensual relations with students, and its policy requiring honesty and cooperation in university matters\".\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIEEE Fellow (1993) for contribution to multi-user communication and information theory.\nFrederick Emmons Terman Award from the American Society for Engineering Education (2000)\nIEEE Third Millennium Medal (2000)\nDoctorate Honoris Causa from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (2005)\nMember of the National Academy of Engineering (2007)\nMember of the National Academy of Sciences (2014)\nCorresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Engineering of Spain  (2013)\nClaude E.

        "context": "Jarkko J. Kari is a Finnish mathematician and computer scientist, known for his contributions to the theory of Wang tiles and cellular automata.  Kari is currently a professor at the Department of Mathematics, University of Turku.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKari received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the University of Turku; his dissertation, supervised by Arto Salomaa.\nHe married Lila Kari, a later mathematics student at Turku; they divorced, and afterwards Lila Kari became a professor of computer science at the University of Western Ontario in Canada.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nWang tiles are unit squares with colored markings on each side; they may be used to tesselate the plane, but only with tiles that have matching colors on adjoining edges. The problem of determining whether a set of Wang tiles forms a valid tessellation is undecidable, and its undecidability rests on finding sets of Wang tiles that can only tesselate the plane aperiodically, in such a way that no translation of the plane is a symmetry of the tiling. The first set of aperiodic Wang tiles found, by Robert Berger, had over 20,000 different tiles in it. Kari reduced the size of this set to only 14, by finding a set of tiles that (when used to tile the plane) simulates the construction of a Beatty sequence by Mealy machines. The same approach was later shown to lead to aperiodic sets of 13 tiles, the minimum known. Kari has also shown that the Wang tiling problem remains undecidable in the hyperbolic plane, and has discovered sets of Wang tiles with additional mathematical properties.\nKari has also used the Wang tiling problem as the basis of proofs that several algorithmic problems in the theory of cellular automata are undecidable. In particular, in his thesis research, he showed that it is undecidable to determine whether a given cellular automaton rule in two or more dimensions is reversible. For one-dimensional cellular automata, reversibility is known to be decidable, and Kari has provided tight bounds on the size of the neighborhood needed to simulate the reverse dynamics of reversible one-dimensional automata.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJarkko Kari's personal homepage"

        "context": "Radhika Nagpal is an Indian-American computer scientist and researcher in the fields of self-organising computer systems, biologically-inspired robotics, and biological multi-agent systems. She is the Augustine Professor in Engineering in the Departments of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science at Princeton University. Formerly, she was the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University and the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 2017, Nagpal co-founded a robotics company under the name of Root Robotics. This educational company works to create many different opportunities for those unable to code to learn how.\n\n\n== Education and academic career ==\nNagpal received an S.B. and S.M. in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT in 2001. Her dissertation, \"Programmable Self-Assembly using Biologically-Inspired Local Interactions and Origami Mathematics\", was supervised by Gerald Sussman and Harold Abelson. In it, she presented a language for instructing a sheet of identically-programmed agents to self-assemble into a desired shape making use only of local interactions, and in a manner robust to irregularities, communication failure, and agent malfunction.\nFrom 2001 to 2003, she served as a postdoctoral lecturer at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, as a member of the Amorphous Computing Group. From 2004 to 2009, she served as an assistant professor of computer science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; from 2009 to 2012, she served as the Thomas D. Cabot Associate Professor of Computer Science at Harvard SEAS. From 2012 to 2019, she served as the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard SEAS, where she headed the Self-Organizing Systems Research Group. In 2022, she moved her SSR lab to Princeton Robotics with joint appointments between the departments of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the department of computer science.\n\n\n== Academic research ==\nHer research group focuses on biologically-inspired multi-agent systems: collective algorithms, programming paradigms, modular and swarm robotics, and on  biological multi-agent systems: models of multicellular morphogenesis, collective insect behavior. This work lies at the intersection of computer science (AI/robotics) and biology. It studies bio-inspired algorithms, programming paradigms, and hardware designs for swarm/modular robotic systems and smart materials, drawing inspiration mainly from social insects and multicellular biology. It also investigates models of self-organization in biology, specifically how cells cooperate during the development of multicellular organisms.\n\n\n=== Programming paradigms for robust collective behavior ===\nHer primary research interest is developing programming paradigms for robust collective behavior, inspired by biology.   Ultimately, the goal is to create a framework for the design and analysis of self-organising multi-agent systems. Her group's approach is to formalize these strategies as algorithms, analysis, theoretical models, and programming languages. They are especially interested in global-to-local compilation, the ability to specify user goals at the high level and automatically derive provable strategies at the agent level.\n\n\n=== Understanding robust collective behavior in biological systems ===\nAnother of her research interests is in understanding robust collective behavior in biological systems. Building artificial systems can give us insights into how complex global properties can arise from identically-programmed parts --- for example, how cells can form scale-independent patterns, how large morphological variations can arise from small genetic changes, and how complex cascades of decisions can tolerate variations in timing. She is interested in mathematical and computational models of multi-cellular behavior, that capture hypotheses of cell behavior and cell-cell interactions as multi-agent systems, and can be used to provide insights into systems level behavior that should emerge. Her group works in close collaboration with biologists, and currently studies growth and pattern formation in the fruit fly wing.\n\n\n== Academic positions ==\nNagpal has held the following positions as a researcher and an academic:\n\nBell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ from 1994-1995 as a technical staff member\nMIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Amorphous Computing Group from 2001-2003 as a postdoctoral lecturer\nHarvard Medical School from 2003-2004 as a research fellow\nHarvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences from 2004-2009 as an assistant professor of Computer Science\nHarvard Medical School, Department of Systems Biology since 2004 as an affiliated faculty member\nHarvard Wyss Institute for Biological-inspired Engineering since 2008 as a Core Faculty Member\nHarvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences from 2009 to 2012 as an associate professor of computer science\nHarvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences since 2012 as the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nNational Talent Search Scholarship Award, India (1987)\nAT&T Bell Labs GRPW Fellowship (1995-2001)\nMicrosoft New Faculty Fellowship (2005)\nNSF Career Award (2007)\nAnita Borg Early Career Award (2010)\nRadcliffe Fellowship (2012)\nnamed one of \"Nature's 10\" people who mattered\" of 2014\nMcDonald Mentoring Award (2015)\nAAAI Fellow (2020)\nDuring her time as Radcliffe Fellow, she worked with experimental biologists to develop a better understanding of collective intelligence in social insects through the application of computer science.\n\n\n== References =="

        "context": "The theory of the least objectionable program (LOP) is a mediological theory explaining television audience behavior. It was developed in the 1960s by then executive of audience measurement at NBC, Paul L. Klein, who was greatly influenced by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media.\n\n\n== \"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\" ==\nIn an article \"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\" (published in TV Guide in 1971), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of television rather than television shows, treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast.\nThis is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to \"watch television\", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find \"something they like\" – because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like – but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel.\n(Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.)\nThus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, \"disturbing their reverie\" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, cliché, \"instantly familiar,\" predictable, and monotonous in tone.\n\n\n== Least offensive programming ==\nLeast offensive programming (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) was a strategy employed mainly by major US television networks, approximately from the 1940s to late 1970s, where viewer numbers were thought to be sustained by television programming that offended the fewest viewers.  The result was an often mass-produced, bland output of popular culture focused on leisure, targeting the American middle class. The theory was popularized by Klein.\n\n\n=== Examples of LOP guidelines ===\nFairly positive images of a show\nCan deal with serious issues but still needs to be upbeat\nLikeable characters\nLack of controversy\nRemember the dynamics of TV today\n\n\n== List of shows as LOP ==\nNCIS: New Orleans\nMadam Secretary\nScorpion\nGrace Under Fire\nJust Shoot Me\nMurphy Brown\nRoseanne\n\n\n== Obsolescence of the theory ==\nIt has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high quality shows, top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of DVDs and Netflix.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLorrie Faith Cranor, Shane M.

He is Professor of Information Systems at University of Bath, following posts at the University of West of England and the Open University. and has conducted ground breaking research into the psychology of Internet usage.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nJoinson studied for his undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of London, Goldsmiths College in 1991. He then went to the University of Hertfordshire to obtain his PhD in Social Psychology in 1996.\nHe has written a number of books, journal articles and proceedings that discuss major themes of psychology such as Social Penetration Theory, Cognitive Dissonance and Expectancy violations theory. The titles of these books include \"Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour\". He has also edited \"The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology\". He is a Programme Director of research on 'Understanding and Countering Online Behaviour' at the Centre for Research on Security Threats.\n\n\n== Areas of Research ==\nJoinson's research interests are focused on the interactions between people and technology. In particular, the nature of communication via technology, and the ways in which system design influences communication.\n\n\n=== Findings ===\nIn 2000, Joinson and his team of scientists carried out a groundbreaking study which looked into the psychological consequences of e-mail communication. He asked 100 pairs of students (who did not know each other) to resolve a dilemma, either face-to-face or via e-mail. When presenting the team's findings at the British Psychological Society's London conference, Joinson stated that the participants \"disclosed over four times as much when they communicated over the Internet as when they talked face-to-face\". The study concluded that \"e-mailing strips away inhibitions because it changes the rues of normal communications\". However, with the addition of web cams to the study, the number of disclosures dropped immediately. This suggested that the use of e-mail gives a sense of \"distance, anonymity and privacy\".\nIn 2007, a project led by Joinson, Privacy and Self-Disclosure Online discovered that users who had previously demonstrated a high level of caution regarding online privacy would accept losses to their privacy if they trusted the recipient of their personal information. Out of all the participants studied, 56 per cent of Internet users stated that they had concerns about privacy when they were online. Joinson concluded the project by stating \"one of the most interesting aspects of our findings, is that even people who genuinely have a high level of concern regarding privacy online may act in a way that is contrary to their stated attitudes when they come across a particular set of conditions\".\nIn an interview with Interattivo in 2008, Joinson stated the findings of a study into the social networking site of Facebook and how the general public used it. His study included: \"...two parts. In the first, 137 users were asked what they used Facebook for, what they most enjoyed about using the site, and what uses were most important to them. These responses were then clustered by trained raters. Selected answers from each cluster were then turned into a questionnaire that 241 people completed, and statistical techniques used to identify activities that occurred together.......A number of surprising findings emerged. First, the amount of time people spend on the site is predicted not by their number of friends, but by the amount they interact with the applications within Facebook. In fact, spending time interacting with applications was associated with having fewer friends on Facebook. Second, the majority of the respondents had changed their privacy settings, but some had made themselves more open, which was motivated by a desire to meet new people – so they made themselves 'discoverable'. Third, the frequency of visits to the site was motivated by an interest in photographs and in other people's news (via their 'status' updates)\".\nIn 2010, Joinson spoke with The Daily Telegraph about his belief that social media may have negative effects on privacy and intimacy levels between people. He stated \"as new technology and social media encourage sharing of the small details of everyday life, it also reduces privacy in social relationships, and may have negative effects on intimacy levels between people. If you desire intimacy, it may well be disastrous to add your partner to Facebook, or to follow them on Twitter\".\n\n\n=== Media Interviews ===\nIn 2002, a survey conducted by search engine AltaVista found that 80% of men claimed to be better surfers than their female partners. Joinson, asked by the BBC, suggested the findings bear out traditional gender stereotypes. He stated \"as information has become such a valuable commodity, it's not surprising that men have transferred their traditional hunter-gatherer role to hunting for information on the web\". Joinson however suggests that he would be \"surprised if men's self-perceived superiority is grounded in fact\".\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJoinson has published over 60 journal articles, and has released three books:\n\nUnderstanding the Psychology of Internet Behavior (2003) (ISBN 0333984684)\nThe Oxford handbook of Internet psychology (2007) (ISBN 019956180X)\nTruth, Lies and Trust on the Internet (2009) (ISBN 184169584X)\n\n\n=== Papers ===\nJoinson AN, Reips U.-D., Buchanan TB, & Paine-Schofield CB (2011) Privacy, Trust and Self-Disclosure Online Human-Computer Interaction 25(1): 1-24DOI: 10.1080/07370020903586662\nVasalou, A., Joinson A.M.& Courvoisier D.

        "answer": "2014",
        "context": "John Maron Abowd (born December 22, 1951) is the Associate director for research and methodology and chief scientist of the US Census Bureau, where he serves on leave from his position as the Edmund Ezra Day Professor of Economics, professor of information science, and member of the Department of Statistical Science at Cornell University.\nAt Cornell, Abowd has taught and conducted research since 1987, including seven years on the faculty of the Johnson Graduate School of Management. Abowd is best known for his contributions in the field of labor economics, and in particular his work in creating, disseminating, and using longitudinal employee-employer matched data.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAbowd received a BA in economics (with highest honors) from the University of Notre Dame in 1973 and a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 1977, under supervision of Arnold Zellner.\nPrior to arriving at Cornell University in 1987, Abowd served on the faculty at Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn addition to his professorship at Cornell University, Abowd is currently a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a research affiliate at the Centre de Recherche en Economie et Statistique (CREST), and a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA). Abowd is also the director of the Labor Dynamics Institute (LDI) at Cornell.\nAbowd is the 2014 president of the Society of Labor Economists. He was chair in 2013 for the Business and Economic Statistics Section and fellow of the American Statistical Association. He is an elected member of the International Statistical Institute (2012). Abowd served as a distinguished senior research fellow at the United States Census Bureau from 1998 to 2012. He also served on the National Academies' Committee on National Statistics from 2010 to 2013 and as director of the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER) from 1999 to 2007.\nAbowd has been the principal investigator or co-principal investigator for multiyear grants and contracts from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\nAbowd, along with John Haltiwanger and Julia Lane, received the 2014 Roger Herriot Award from the American Statistical Association for work improving federal data collection, and in particular work developing and disseminating employee-employer matched data through the Census Bureau's LEHD Program.\n\n\n== Current research ==\nAbowd's current research focuses on the creation, dissemination, privacy protection, and use of matched longitudinal data on employers and employees. Abowd helped to found and continues to provide scientific leadership for the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program, which integrates censuses, demographic surveys, economic surveys, and administrative data to produce research and public-use data.\nAbowd's other research interests include network models for integrated labor market data; statistical methods for confidentiality protection of microdata, including the creation of synthetic data; international comparisons of labor market outcomes; executive compensation; bargaining and other wage-setting institutions; and the econometric tools of labor market analysis.\n\n\n== Major contributions to economics ==\nAbowd has published a large number of articles on a variety of subjects in labor economics. His work has appeared in the American Economic Review, Econometrica, the Review of Economics and Statistics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Journal of the American Statistical Association, the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, the Journal of Econometrics, and other major economics and statistics journals.\nAmong Abowd's most influential articles was \"High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms\", in which Abowd, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis used a matched sample of French employees and employers to decompose annual compensation into components related to observable employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity, and residual variation. Their econometric approach, now widely referred to as the \"AKM decomposition,\" laid the groundwork for a large body of subsequent research using employee-employer linked data in labor economics to understand topics including inter-industry wage differentials, firm size-wage effects, and job search and matching in the labor market.\nIn other widely cited work with David Card, Abowd used longitudinal data to analyze changes in individual earnings and hours over time. Abowd and Card explored the covariance structure of earnings and hours and interpreted them in the context of a life-cycle model of labor supply.\nAbowd also has written extensively on executive compensation, and in particular on whether performance-based compensation affects corporate performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn M.
